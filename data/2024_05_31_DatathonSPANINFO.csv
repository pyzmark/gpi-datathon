Fernández de Navarrete was in the royal bureaucracy, and his collection included a set of portraits of the Spanish royal family (no. 45) as well as one of Philip III's privado, the Duque de Lerma (no. 18). He was also the author of a political treatise on the problems of the kingdom of Spain, Conservación de monarquías y discursos políticos sobre la gran consulta que el consejo hizo a D. Felipe Tercero (1626). His collection may have been formed some years before his death in 1632; the fact that it is made up entirely of portraits and images of religious subjects perhaps reflects the extremely pious atmosphere of the court during the latter part of the reign of Philip III. Although it is unusual that the collection contained no decorative subjects, such as still lifes and landscapes, it is worth noting that the predominance of religious narratives and devotional subjects would have been entirely typical of most collections formed by lower-ranking courtiers and non-noble individuals in the early seventeenth century. Two paintings were said to be by El Greco (nos. 7, 38) and there was a copy on copper of a Magdalene by Titian (no. 35), but while the values of some pictures were comparatively high, the vast majority were listed anonymously.","Collectors Files:  Fernández de Navarrete, Pedro, Secretario","input"

The Conde's enormous library valued 25 August 1635 ff.858-875 in which titles of books given.' Wife's name was María de Fonseca y Toledo (sister of Fernando de Ayala Fonseca y Toledo, I Conde de Ayala)","Don Francisco de Eraso, Conde de Humanes, and a member of the Consejo Real de las Indias, died on 24 September 1635. The inventory of his estate was drawn up by his widow María de Fonseca y Ulloa, Condesa de Umanes, beginning in Madrid on 28 September. The conde was a close friend and confidant of Philip IV's privado, the Conde-Duque de Olivares, and, like him, was a bibliophile, owning an enormous library of books. His collection of some 58 paintings, however, was comparatively small for a member of the Spanish nobility. These were valued on 18 November 1635 by Francisco Gómez, who styled himself painter to the King. Despite the small size of Humanes' collection, some of his paintings were clearly very choice pieces. While he owned a set of the twelve Months of the Year copied from prototypes by the Bassani (no. 1), his five original religious subjects by Jacopo da Ponte and another member of the family (nos. 11-15) must have been the envy of many collectors at court. Given the almost universal admiration of the skill of the Bassani in painting animals, it is not surprising that the most highly valued painting in the collection was Noah's Ark by Bassano (no. 12). Humanes also owned examples of religious painting by two important artists patronized by Philip II. The Genoese painter Luca Cambiaso worked at the Escorial, and the high value of Humanes' Ecce Homo by this artist (no. 16) suggests that this was a highly esteemed painting of great quality, worth many times more than the copy after Titian's Ecce Homo from the Spanish royal collection (no. 18). Philip II's royal portraitist Alonso Sánchez Coello was represented by a Coronation of the Virgin (no. 10). While the document did not identify Sánchez Coello as the author of any of Humanes' portraits, two valuable ancestral portraits painted by Antonio Mor (nos. 4, 5) probably formed an inalienable part of the family collection. This collector's apparent lack of interest in contemporary Spanish artists and some of the newer secular subject matters, such as genre and still-life paintings, raises the distinct possibility that many of the pictures in Humanes' inventory had passed to him through inheritance.","Collectors Files:  Umanes, Francisco de Herasso, Conde de","input"

While a small number of devotional paintings were commonly included in dowry agreements of the non-aristocratic classes, it is more unusual to find attributed works of considerable value included in such documents of this period. Although the majority of the paintings were of religious subjects, four of the older works were landscapes (no. 18). The most valuable painting of all was a genre picture, listed as an original depicting a Fowl Vendor (no. 15), apparently an old work by the same hand as two panels representing Herodias and a Calvary (nos. 13, 14). A curious aspect of this document is the large number of works by a single hand which the bride's father included in her dowry. Two paintings were possibly imported from Italy (nos. 12, 16), but most of the paintings were religious subjects painted in Madrid by Eugenio Caxés. These were listed with the important qualification that they were originals, and many were works of considerable value. One explanation for this is that it may have been felt that paintings by an artist of Tuscan extraction were appropriate for a Florentine son-in-law.","Collectors Files:  Ramírez y Vargas, Isabel","input"

This collector had a taste for small paintings on metal and panel; the first 25 pictures listed were such works (nos. 1-19), 12 of which were of the same size and framed in the same manner with ebony and pearwood. Not all of these were of religious subjects, however; Gómez de Arratia shared a courtly taste for mythological subjects, which included the stories of Diana (nos. 4, 5), Venus (no. 32), Bacchus (no. 13), and Argos (no. 25). His paintings of the heads of Romulus and Remus (nos. 14) and of Roman Charity (no. 21) suggest that his taste did not simply imitate that of his social superiors, but that this was an educated collector with classical interests. He owned two portraits of his patron, the Infante-Cardinal Don Ferdinand (nos. 23, 39) and a number of genre subjects, which may have been Flemish (nos. 33, 36, 37), but the only attributed work in the document was a copy after Bassano of an unspecified subject.","Collectors Files:  Gómez de Arratia, Jusepe","input"

The inventory was taken, beginning 3 August 1624, by the Duchess, who held all the titles (e.g., Duquesa del Infantado, Marquesa de Santillana del Mar, Marquesa del Cenote, de Arquiso, de Campos) in her own right except Mandas [cf. fol. 1442]. Included are tapestries [fols. 1044-47], paintings [fols. 1110v-1159 -- 21 August 1624], and religious images (or ensembles) in painting and sculpture [fols. 1204-16], with those belonging to the Duchess listed in a separate category.  Some of the imágenes are said to be painted on canvas, some on panel or other two-dimensional media;  others may have been painted reliefs, such as polychromed wood relief.  Since these objects did not form part of Don Juan's personal collection, they seem not to have been included in the evaluation.  The evaluation was begun in September 1624 in preparation for an almoneda.  The paintings were appraised [fols. 1274-97] by Juan de la Corte and Matías Jiménez on 2 September 1624 and following;  a number of the pictures were marked no se vende in the margin.  There were 439 numbered lots, followed by tapestries [fols. 1044-1047].  Sculpture and objets d'art are evaluated by Luis de Espinas and Jacques Mayer, plateros [fols. 1335-1340, nos. 845-908].' The various sections of the inventory are careful to distinguish among works inherited by Doña Ana from the Infantado patrimony, objects bought by her with her own money, and objects bought or inherited by Don Juan during the marriage.  In particular, the paintings section distinguishes between what the previous Duque del Infantado, Don Iñigo, left and what Don Juan bought or inherited in his own right.  [A related document, supplements the inventories at Madrid (e.g., books in the library) and adds objects at the Infantado Palace in Guadalajara. (And later includes the appraisal of the books by Damian Ruiz, librero, at Madrid 17 March 1625, and the appraisal of paintings in Guadalajara by Diego Verganza, pintor, 19 November 1624.)]  The tasación of objects in Madrid was begun in September 1624 (paintings, 2-4 September 1624, ff. 1274-1297v) in preparation for an almoneda; Juan de la Corte and Matías Jiménez were the evaluators (approximately 780 paintings in 439 numbered lots). Miscellaneous pictures, and almost all of the objects belonging to the Duchess Doña Ana in her own right, had been removed from consideration before the appraisal (see Burke 1984, Document 2.14g).  [A second related document records the almoneda, dated in madrid 11-12 September 1624.]  The lot numbers of the present tasación are noted in the margins of the AHN sales record.'

His parents were: Iñigo López de Mendoza y Mendoza, III Marqués de Mondéjar, IV Conde de Tendilla, Señor de Almoguera, Capitán General del Reino de Granada y su Alhambra, Embajador en Roma, Virrey de Valencia y de Nápoles y otros cargos and María de Mendoza y Aragón, daughter of the IV Duque de Infantado. His wife Ana de Mendoza was the daughter of Iñigo López de Mendoza y Mendoza V Duque del Infantado, VI Marqués de Santillana, V Conde del Real de Manzanares, IV Marqués del Cenete, Conde del Cid, y VIII Señor de Hita y Buitrago and his wife, Luisa Enríquez de Cabrera (daughter of Luis Enríquez, Almirante de Castilla y Duque de Medina de Ríoseco) Therefore, Juan's maternal grandfather was the IV Duque del Infantado, and his wife was the VI Duquesa del Infantado. folio 1140 and its recto is very torn.

The embassy of Don Ruy Gómez de Silva de Mendoza y de la Cerda, Duque de Pastrana, Príncipe de Melito y de Eboli in Rome from 1623 to 1626, has been analyzed in the Introduction. Sometime around 1638-39, Don Ruy Gómez's son, Don Rodrigo de Silva y Mendoza, Duque de Pastrana from 1626, married Doña Catalina Gómez de Sandoval y Mendoza, who had been Duquesa del Infantado from 1633. Their son, Don Gregorio de Silva Medoza y Sandoval (22 May 1640-10 November 1693) was consequently Duque de Pastrana y de Estremera, Príncipe de Melito y de Eboli, and Conde de Saldaña from the death of his father in 1675, and Duque del Infantado (Lerma, Mandas), Marqués de Santillana y del Cenete from the death of his mother, which presumably occurred in the late 1670s or 1680s, but certainly before April 1690, when her daughter-in-law made a will under the titles of both houses. (Don Gregorio entered the Order of Santiago in 1666--perhaps the occasion celebrated in Carreno's portrait, now at the Prado, no. 650--and received the Toison d'Or on 11 May 1693.) Thus were the collections of the houses of Infantado and Pastrana united. Unfortunately, the Infantado inventory of Doña Catalina Gómez de Sandoval y Mendoza, presumably taken between 1675 and 1690, has not been located, and the Pastrana inventory of Don Rodrigo de Silva y Mendoza, taken in 1676, is nearly devoid of attributions, except for two portraits by Sánchez Coello. As a result, we have little information on the combined collection at a critical point in its history. (It is not until 1737 that we encounter another inventory.)  The will relating to the estate of Don Juan Hurtado de Mendoza de la Vega y Luna (Alcántara), 6th Duque [Consort] del Infantado, Duque de Mandas, Marqués de Cenete, Marqués de Santillana, Mayordomo Mayor del Rey, Gentleman to the King's Bedchamber, Member of the Councils of State and War was certified posthumously on 26 November 1624, Don Juan having died on 1 August 1624. The inventory was taken beginning 3 August 1624 by the Duquesa, Ana de Mendoza de la Vega y Luna, who held all the titles (e.g., 6th Duquesa del Infantado, Marquesa de Santillana del Mar, Marquesa del Cenete, de Arquiso, de Campos) except Mandas in her own right (cf. f. 1442). Included are tapestries (ff. 1044-47), paintings (ff. 1110v-1159v, 21-27 August 1624), and religious images (or ensembles) in painting and sculpture (ff. 1204-16, 24 September 1624), with those belonging to the duquesa listed in a separate category. Some of the imágenes are said to be painted on canvas, some on panel or other two-dimensional media; others may have been painted reliefs, of polychromed wood. Since these objects did not form part of Don Juan's personal collection, they seem not to have been included in the valuation. A number of other paintings were inventoried as addenda after the valuation was already under way (ff. 1209-1210, 1215v-1216v; 21 October 1624). The valuation was begun in September 1624 in preparation for an almoneda. The paintings were appraised (ff. 1274-97) by Juan de la Corte and Matías Jiménez on 2-4 September 1624. There were 439 numbered lots, followed by tapestries (ff. 1044-1047); a number of the pictures were marked no se vende in the margin. Sculpture and objets d'art are appraised by Luis de Espinas and Jacques Mayer, plateros (ff. 1335-1340, nos. 845-908). Miscellaneous pictures, and almost all of the objects belonging to the Duquesa Doña Ana in her own right, were removed from consideration before the appraisal (See also Pérez Pastor 1914, p. 170, no. 857). The various sections of the inventory are careful to distinguish among works inherited by Doña Ana from the Infantado patrimony, objects bought by her with her own money, and objects bought or inherited by Don Juan during the marriage. The paintings section also distinguishes between what the previous Duque del Infantado, Don Iñigo, left and what Don Juan bought or inherited from other sources in his own right. The transcriptions of the 1624 documents follow the valuation, with further lots added from the inventories as necessary.","Collectors Files: Infantado, Duque del","input"

Juana Lucia Lopez Pueyo, daughter of Vicente Lopez.  Vucht's capital totalled 434.632 reales.'","Pedro van Vucht was a Flemish merchant resident at the court of Madrid. In 1642 he married Juana Lucia López Pueyo, daughter of Vicente López, and drew up a document of appraisal of his capital assets brought to the union on 6 April 1642, as was customary for a second marriage. His total moveable assets were worth some 434,632 reales. Van Vucht's paintings were appraised by the French painter Jean Ducamps (ca.1600-1650), known in Spain as Juan del Campo, the name with which he signed this document. The choice of this artist, who also worked for the Duc d'Aarschot, may have seemed appropriate to a Flemish collector, whose collection included important northern pictures. Del Campo may have been a prominent personality among collectors of Flemish art in Madrid, and the Marqués de Leganés gave him a seascape painted by Paul Bril (López Navío 1962, p. 280, no. 246). The picture frames were valued by the Flemish cabinet-maker Abraham Lers (Abraham Leerse), who had built the frame for Rubens' Martyrdom of St. Andrew, the altarpiece of the Chapel of the Madrid Hospital de los Flamencos. (This painting had been bequeathed in 1639 by the will of Jan van Vucht, who was the Madrid agent of Balthasar Moretus's printing works. See H. Vlieghe, Saints I, Corpus Rubenianum Ludwig Burchard VIII, London and New York, 1972, p. 89.) Not surprisingly, perhaps, the only attributed works in Pedro van Vucht's inventory of capital were by Flemish masters, although some of these are difficult to identify today. The most highly valued picture in the collection, a Descent from the Cross probably by Jacob Jordaens (no. 1), was first in the document. Two other important northern works were allegories of the Five Senses and Four Elements by Gerardo (?) (nos. 4,5). Three landscapes with animals and birds by another obscure painter, one Pedro de Berois(?), were said to have hung over windows (no. 9). A painting of a lion hunt (no. 36) was another subject painted by northern specialists, which were much sought after by collectors in Madrid. The collection of his brother Jan van Vucht in 1628 listed two Rubens hunting scenes, one of lions and the other of leopards. (AHPM, Prot. 5.185, ff. 403-425 for the inventory of Jan van Vucht drawn up on the death of his wife, María Blist, opened on 20 March 1628. The Rubens paintings were listed as dos liencos de Rubbens el Uno cassa de leones y el otro de lupardes, worth 1,200 reales. The only other attributed paintings were two paintings of Europa and her nymphs and Jupiter and the gods by banbal.) Van Vucht's four landscapes copied after paintings by the Bassani reflect the almost universal admiration for such images in seventeenth-century Spain. One would also like to know the name of the painter of Van Vucht's full-length portrait (no. 8) and another smaller portrait of this sitter (no. 33).","Collectors Files:  Vucht, Pedro Van","input"

Photocopy of Inventory of Pinturas, beginning in Madrid 22 January 1646, ff.273v-301, numbered 1-337.  Last day of inventory, 28 January 1646.'","Don Gaspar de Borja y de Velasco (1582-1645) was born into one of the great noble houses of Spain, being the son of Francisco Tomás de Borja y Centellas, 6th Duque de Gandía, 1st Conde de Valencia, and Juana de Velasco y de Aragón, daughter of Iñigo Fernández de Velasco, 5th Condestable de Castilla (García Carraffa 1919-63, t. 18, pp. 118-119). He pursued a distinguished career in the church, which took him from a canonry of the cathedral of Cuenca to the archbishopric of Seville (1632-1643). In Italy, he was Archbishop of Milan, a cardinal at the papal court in Rome -- where he was a protector of Giovanni Baglione (Pérez Sanchez 1965, p. 67) -- and extraordinary ambassador of Philip III in Rome in 1616, as well as interim Viceroy of Naples in 1620; by the time of his death on 28 December 1645 he had risen to one of the highest ecclesiastical offices in Spain as Archbishop of Toledo. The detailed inventory of Cardinal Borja's picture collection was drawn up in Madrid by his brother Don Melchor Zentellan de Borja on 22 January 1646. In the document, measurements are given in palmi (probably the Roman palmo of 22.5 cm.), which suggests that it follows an earlier list of his paintings drawn up during his residence in Rome. It is likely too that the majority of his pictures were acquired in Italy. The collection was almost entirely made up of religious subjects, as was appropriate for one of Spain's most pious and prominent princes of the church. In the accounts of the Duque de Pastrana's embassy to Rome between 1623 and 1626, one large Nativity of Christ was listed as having been given to him by Cardinal Borja (AHNM, Sección Osuna, cartas, legajo 582, packet 166 bis). Many of Borja's devotional images were painted on copper, as was a St. Francis by Giuseppe Cesari (no. 69), one of the few named artists in the inventory. Some items were covered with curtains. The profane genres were represented by a large number of landscape paintings, many of which formed sets and were painted on copper, as well as fruit still lifes and flowerpieces. The collection also included allegorical series of the Elements, Seasons, Parts of the World, and the Virtues. Cardinal Borja's portrait collection comprised one group representing members of his family, which included a portrait of Borja himself (nos. 161, 176). Toward the end of the inventory there was a full-length portrait of Philip IV (no. 314), described as old, perhaps denoting that it was a version of Velázquez's two prototypes dating from the 1620s. A hunting portrait of Prince Baltasar Carlos (no. 299) was almost certainly a version of Velázquez's portrait of Prince Baltasar Carlos in Hunting Costume (Madrid, Prado) painted for the Torre de la Parada. There were two portraits of the Conde-Duque de Olivares (nos. 297, 298), one full-length and the other half-length. The life-sized portrait of Cardinal Borja himself seated in a chair (no. 296) must record Velázquez's lost portrait, painted in 1645. It lends support to the belief that Velázquez's original represented the sitter full-length, seated in a chair, as shown in a copy (78.7 x 53.4 cm.) that was in the Flatter Collection (London). Although the portrait itself is lost, a magnificent preparatory chalk drawing by Velázquez is in the collection of the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando (Fig. 34).","Collectors Files:  Borja y Velasco, Gaspar de, Arzobispo de Toledo, Cardenal","input"

His wife, Da. Catalina Maldonado Mesia, draws up his inventory on his death, beginning in Madrid 14 September 1637, but interrupted until 2 May 1639. Photocopy (i) is Inventory of Espejo's paintings, 4 May 1639.  Photocopy (ii) is inventory of Espejo's paintings taken at his property at Olias (Toledo), 11 July 1640.'","Hernando de Espejo (d. 5 August 1637) was a prominent courtier during the reigns of both Philip III and Philip IV who, when he died in 1637, held the title of Caballerizo de la Reina. He was knight of the Order of Santiago and comendador of Torres y Cañamares, which signified that he was entitled to receive rents from this benefice owned by the order. Espejo also occupied the important palace office of guardajoyas under Philip III, with responsibilities for the royal collection of silverware, liturgical objects and jewelry (including royal toisons de oro) which required Espejo always to be at hand and in continual service in the palace. The painter Luis Tristán pointed out in his annotations to Vasari's Life of Titian that Philip III had removed from the public view Titian's mythological paintings and a Tarquin and Lucretia, which had been given over to Espejo for safekeeping (X. Salas and F. Marías, El Greco y el arte de su tiempo. Las notas de El Greco a Vasari, Toledo, 1992, p. 142).  It was in this role that Espejo probably came into contact with two painters in the royal service, Pedro Guzmán El Cojo, pintor del rey from 1601-1616, and Bartolomé González (1564-1627) whose works he owned. Although Espejo's widow, Catalina Maldonado Mesía y Tovar, began his postmortem inventory in Madrid on 14 September 1637, this was interrupted until 2 May 1639. Espejo's paintings collection in his property at Madrid was inventoried on 2 May 1639 (ff. 15-16) and appraised two days later by the painter Juan Antonio Ceronio (ff. 23-26v). Espejo's collection would appear to reflect the particularly devout taste for paintings that was in ascendance at court during the reign of Philip III. One of the most valuable paintings was a Flemish Nativity (no. 1). His Annunciation from Florence (no. 4) was most probably a copy of the miraculous thirteenth-century fresco from S. Annunziata which was popular among collectors in the early part of the century, with copies in the royal collection and the collections of the Duque de Lerma and Condesa de Lemos (Condesa de Lemos, Doc. 11, no. 29. See also in this publication: Doc. 9, no. 403; Doc. 68, no. 18; Doc. 23, no. 4; and Doc. 14, no. 7). The only attributed works in the valuation were to two of the most prominent court painters of the reign of Philip III and were devotional paintings. One was a Crucified Christ painted on a walnut cross by Pedro de Guzmán (El Cojo) (no. 23), and a Virgin and Suckling Christ Child by Bartolomé González (no. 18). This latter painting may be the painting of the Virgen de la leche by Bartolomé González today in the royal convent of La Encarnación in Madrid, founded by Queen Margarita, or a version of it (M.T. Ruíz Alcón, Real Monasterio dela Encarnación, Madrid, 1987, p. 30, illustration). Another document, discussed in the Introduction, shows that Espejo directly patronized González, from whom he commissioned six paintings of saints and three portraits. Espejo's collection was made up mostly of religious paintings, and he owned no mythological narrative subjects. Two of the religious pictures were in the form of reliquaries (nos. 10, 11). Some of these images on copper were set into elaborate, precious frames made of ebony, silver, and bronze, which made the works very valuable (no. 12, 13) and necessitated the expert intervention of a cabinetmaker and silversmith in their appraisal (nos. 16, 17). The painter Ceronio also appears to have valued the two sculptures included with the pictures (nos. 20, 21). Although Espejo owned no paintings of mythological subjects, there were two curious works in his collection that appear to have been arcane allegories with Cupid in a landscape format (no. 31). There was an example of the popular classical subject of the Burning of Troy, which was paired with a seascape with ships (no. 37). Among Espejo's landscape pictures (no. 32), there were two Flemish pictures whose value suggests works of considerable quality (no. 30), and two sets of Four Seasons (no. 25). One of the most interesting groups of secular paintings made up two decorative friezes in rooms of Espejo's Madrid house (nos. 35, 36): one was a frieze of 17 pictures representing landscapes and birds and another of 12 pictures of fruit and birds. The fact that these both measured 35 varas long and were valued by length perhaps suggests that the images were painted as quadri riportati onto a continuous canvas strip rather than being separate and independent canvases. Such nature themes were appropriate to the rural setting of this house. Further paintings hung at Espejo's house in the country at Olias (Toledo) and were valued by a resident there, one Pedro de Alegría, on 11 July 1640 (ff. 42v-44). While the majority of these were not Espejo's best works, and were described as ziertas Pinturas Hordinarias questava en la cassa (ff. 36-38), the collection did include a number of valuable portraits. These were listed as four full-length portraits worth 250 reales each, representing Hernando de Espejo himself, his first wife Ana María de Bustos, and his second wife Catalina Maldonado, which were probably the paintings listed in Bartolomé González's receipt of 14 February 1620 (see Introduction), and a portrait of Espejo's father-in-law, Don Juan Maldonado. Espejo's family pride was further expressed in four coats of arms of the Espejos. His loyalty in royal service was clear from a set of 15 portraits of the Spanish Habsburgs and one of the Duque de Lerma.","Collectors Files:  Espejo, Hernando de","input"

Despite their joint expertise, and the high values assigned to some of the pictures, the only attributed works were by the Bassano family. One was a copy of Emmaus (no. 6), and there were five pictures signed by Francesco (II) Bassano, one of the Expulsion from the Temple (no. 7), and a set of Four Seasons (5). These latter works, along with a set of 12 poor-quality flower pictures (no. 14), were the only profane subjects in Angulo's collection.

Photocopy is valuation of D. Francisco's paintings by Angelo Nardi pintor de su Mag.d and Juan Baptista del Mazo ujier de camara y pintor, ff.447-448, 3 April 1651.  The inventory is damaged and far too feint to take a copy.  Paintings are entered in some detail in the rooms where they were hanging and would all have to be copied by hand.  In the Nardi/Mazo valuation only the most salient paintings of this large collection were valued.'","The postmortem inventory of Don Francisco de Prado Bravo de Mendoza, a knight of the Order of Santiago and member of the Consejo Supremo de Italia, was begun in Madrid on 15 September 1650. This was undertaken by his executors, his son and heir Don Bartolomé de Prado Bravo de Mendoza, knight of Santiago and royal secretary, Don Francisco Gracian Berruguete, a royal secretary and interpreter/translator, and the contador Garci Sánchez de Mena. The inventory of the goods in Prado Bravo de Menodoza's house was taken room by room in an orderly fashion, beginning with the oratory. Paintings were inventoried hanging in each room, except for a number that were leaning up against the wall of one room (f. 405), but the function of each room is not given in the document. Unfortunately, the inventory has suffered water damage and is now difficult to read. In the appraisals of goods from the estate, Don Francisco's paintings were valued by the royal painters Angelo Nardi (Pintor de su Majestad) and Juan Baptista del Mazo (Ujier de cámara y pintor) on 3 April 1651. In the Nardi/Mazo valuation only a selection of paintings that were to be offered for sale from this large collection were valued. Despite the combined expertise of two royal painters and Nardi's acknowledged reputation as a connoisseur, only two paintings were clearly attributed in their appraisal. One was a painting of the Virgin by Eugenio Caxés (no. 7). The other was evidently a copy of Titian's Gloria (Madrid, Prado) from the Spanish royal collection, which was one of the most famous paintings at the Escorial (no. 4). The relatively high valuation given to the painting suggests that it was a high-quality work. It was not the only Titian in the collection, however, since a Tribute Money by the artist was also present in the earlier inventory (f. 393, otro quadro del tributo del cesar de bara y media de largo y bara y quarta de ancho del ticiano). In the same gallery (la galeria que sale al patio de la fuente) there were also four paintings representing paired apostles by Juan Fernández de Navarrete (f. 393, quatro liencos de tres [sic] apostoles cada uno con dos con molduras doradas y bruñidas todos quatro del mudo). These appear to have been pictures based on his apostle altarpieces at the Escorial, and were anonymous in the appraisal (no. 3). Furthermore, in the same place was a Meleagar and Atalanta by Rubens (f. 593, Una pintura de quatro baras de ancho y ocho pies de cayda de Rubens -- la qual es de una fabula de meliajar y atalantar). The reason that this painting did not appear in the valuation may have been that it was reserved for the estate, to be inherited by Don Bartolomé de Prado Bravo. This painting would appear to have been a copy of the landscape version of this mythological subject by Rubens that was inventoried in the Madrid Alcázar in 1636, or perhaps a painting by a follower of Rubens, such as Jacob Jordaens (Díaz Padrón 1975, pp. 264-265; p. 162). Bravo de Mendoza's collection included another mythological painting, a Cupid and Psyche, that measured under one vara and was listed in the inventory only. Another classical subject, a Triumph of Scipio (i.e. Scipio Africanus) (no. 9) also appeared in the inventory, where it was said to be a large painting, four varas by three varas, with many figures. A pendant painting valued as a Triumph of Melchizedek (no. 10) was inventoried as de el tributo del cessar (f. 389). The size and subject matter of these multi-figure paintings are entirely consistent with the work of Juan de la Corte. Prado Bravo de Mendoza's painting of the story of the Ethiopian princess Chariclea from Heliodorus' Aethiopica was a very unusual subject and perhaps reflects the depth of its owner's classical erudition. From the evidence of Prado Bravo de Mendoza's inventory, the hanging of pictures in rooms of his house does not appear to have been responsive to thematic imperatives. Religious, profane, and decorative subjects were mixed together on the walls of all of the rooms. In some cases, however, series paintings gave a degree of thematic consistency to the rooms, but even this could not be described as a decorative program. For instance, one room (otra pieça questa Junto a la rreferida acia la calle) was decorated with four paintings of the story of Adam and Eve, which hung alongside a painting of the Five Senses and a large painting of a Flemish kermesse. In the previous room (en la pieça antes de entrar en la galeria) four paintings of the Creation hung with the genre painting of poor people and four fruit still lifes. Fruit still lifes were a major decorative element in the house, hanging in nine of the eleven rooms inventoried. The courtyard of the house (el patio de la fuente) was decorated solely with four fruit still lifes and three flowerpieces in a manner reminiscent of Sevillian houses. One small room (la alcobilla questa cerca de la pieça grande de la calle) was entirely decorated with fruit and flower paintings, made up of five fruit still lifes and six flowerpieces, one of which was from Italy. In the appraisal document, eight paintings of birds were specifically mentioned as forming part of the decoration of a room (nos. 21, 24), while there were so many still lifes that the majority were not itemized (nos. 15, 16, 40).","Collectors Files:  Prado Bravo de Mendoza, Francisco de","input"

Twenty folios, 333 lots.  The inventory appears to be the fifth section of the first book of a complete accounting of Don Gaspar's household, possibly taken at the time of his emancipation from his father, Don Luis de Haro (Don Gaspar would have been twenty-one at the time).  Each entry ends with the words, 'tassado en,' but there are no values given.'","Don Gaspar de Haro y Guzmán, who was known to his contemporaries as the Marqués de Eliche, was baptized at Madrid on 1 June 1629. He was raised at court during the ministry of his great-uncle, the Conde-Duque de Olivares, from whom Don Gaspar was ultimately to inherit the Eliche estates and title (the title of Marqués de Eliche - also spelled Heliche and Liche - was created for Olivares' daughter on the occasion of her marriage in 1624, but when she died without issue, the title was inherited by the sister of Olivares (her aunt) who was married to the 5th Marqués del Carpio. Don Gaspar was styled Marqués de Eliche by the time of his mother's death in 1647 (Saltillo 1951, p. 170 n. and Saltillo 1953, pp. 233-34). It has not been determined what income the title may have generated in 1645). In 1648, Don Gaspar's wealth was further increased by bequests from his mother's will. His inheritance, which consisted mostly of annual rents and mortgage income, was liquidated at nearly 500,000 reales (about 45,000 ducats). In 1650, Don Gaspar married Doña Maria Antonia de la Cerda, the Duque de Medinacoeli's fifteen-year-old daughter, whose beauty was celebrated internationally (See the remarks of the French visitors, Gramont and Bertaut, quoted in Andrés 1975, pp. 8-10). Doña Maria brought a dowry of 100,000 ducats to the wedding, and Don Gaspar in turn gave her 10,000 ducats in rents and another 3,000 ducats for her personal expenses (Maura Gamazo 1911, p. 629). In 1651, Don Gaspar inventoried his personal household; this inventory (the present document) probably indicates the point at which his and his wife's finances were separated from those of his father, Don Luis. (Andrés 1975, p. 9, assumes that Don Gaspar and Doña Maria lived in Don Luis's house, at least until the fire of 1654, mentioned in Chapter 3, above. If this is true, the inventory of 1651 might have been an attempt to separate Don Gaspar and Doña Maria's belongings from the common household.) Don Gaspar's artistic interests appear to have been among the few worthy character traits of his youth. (See Barrionuevo, letters nos. 153, 178, 181, 184, 189, 191, 200, 207-209, 212-13, 222, 251, and 260ff. -- see also vol. 1, 1892, pp. 81, 98, 215, and 259 (miscellaneous notices of 1654-55). Whether from general moral outrage or some particular dislike for Don Gaspar, Barrionuevo's account seems biased against the Marqués (Cosa mala nunca muere. -- letter no. 178, 7 March 1657). Barrionuevo's anonymous successor presents what appears to be a more objective account.) He was, for example, a notorious womanizer. Even after his marriage to a woman described as a great beauty (Bertaut, quoted in Andrés 1975, p. 11, described Doña Maria, Don Gaspar's first wife, as the most beautiful woman in the world ), Don Gaspar maintained a string of scandalous liaisons, often with actresses (See Barrionuevo, letters no. 181 and 222, as well as the contemporary reports quoted in Andrés 1975, pp. 11ff). Perhaps the Rokeby Venus -- one of the rare nudes in seventeenth-century Spanish art -- may be related to this unbounded sexual appetite. Alternating with the reports of scandalous behavior in contemporary chroniclers' accounts are reports of mysterious illnesses (Ibid., vol. 1, 1892, pp. 81 and 98, October 1654, 215, 259; vol. 3, 1893, pp. 226, letter 178, cited above, 331, 447; vol. 4, 1894, p. 92, letter 213, 10 April 1658). Don Gaspar was said to have been hexed by the women he frequented, and his infirmities were often explained in terms of other witchcraft or demonic possession, all of which suggests that Don Gaspar either had an unbalanced mind or was suffering from venereal disease. (Ibid., vol. 1, pp. 81 and 259, wherein Barrionuevo makes the following observations: El Marqués de Liche dicen está hechizado. Aún otros hablan más claro, diciendo son espíritus, y le conjuran de secreto.","","input"

Documents for the History of Collecting: Spanish Inventories 1, Collections of Paintings in Madrid 1601-1755 (Los Angeles: Getty, 1997), pp.830-877.","","","","","Burke writes:  'Tasación of VII Carpio's Ptgs in Spain (1688 inv) - 1689, 31 Oct 1689'","In addition to the posthumous Neapolitan inventory published above (Doc. 114), an inventory of his possessions in Madrid was made in 1689. This document offers valuable information on Don Gaspar's household in the years between his return from exile and internment in Portugal and his departure as Ambassador to Rome. For example, the inventory indicates that, during this period, Don Gaspar occupied four principal residences: the Jardín de San Joaquín, the villa at Moncloa, a house in the parish of San Martín, and a dwelling attached to the Convent at Loeches. The house at San Martín contained only portraits and large decorative pieces, none of which bore attributions. The inventory gives little indication that this house was in daily use in 1689, and the paintings mentioned might merely have been those whose quality did not justify the bother of removing them. (It is not clear whether this house may be identified with the one Don Luis leased from the Duque de Uceda.) The Jardín, on the other hand, was probably Don Gaspar's principal residence. The inventory describes the contents of several álcobas, or bedrooms, along with galleries and a small tower (f. 1030ff.). The Jardín was also the main repository of the art collection; indeed, the density of the hanging scheme suggests a museum more than a home. The villa at Moncloa, apart from the frescoes, held little of interest. Only a few works of quality were recorded at Loeches or as having come from Loeches, although there were many pieces in crates (lo encajonado, f. 1042v and ff.). Finally, the inventory describes a portable oratory at the end of the list of works at Loeches. This was decorated with Titian's Via Crucis (no. 1092) and Penitent Magdalene (no. 1098), and possibly with Don Luis's Cardinals de' Medici, still attributed to Raphael (no. 1099). Since Loeches was the seat of the Olivares, it is worth asking whether some of these may come from the collection of the Conde-Duque. It has been noted that the 1689 inventory appears to lack many works present in the inventories of 1648 and 1651. The most probable explanation for this -- apart from the difficulties of identifying works from varying written descriptions -- is that Don Gaspar was refining his collection. There is evidence that, on at least one occasion, such a winnowing did take place. On 1 June 1674, the Imperial Ambassador, Harrach, visited an almoneda at one of the Carpio residences: In the afternoon I went incognito to visit the Venetian Ambassador, and from him to the almoneda of the Marqués de Liche -- although there was almost nothing on sale except pictures, and most of them only copies, if from good originals (Harrach 1913, p. 96 (entry for 1 June 1674). The original German is given above in the notes to the almirante's collection, Document 43). Don Gaspar had already been named Ambassador to the Holy See by April 1674, but he had not yet left Madrid. His appointment to Rome may have necessitated a sale to raise money for the embassy. It may have been, therefore, an appropriate moment for a general housecleaning. The exclusion of furniture and the low quality of the works offered for sale support this. Unfortunately, the lack of a death inventory for his father, Don Luis, makes it impossible to say how many of the works inventoried in 1689 but absent from the inventories of 1648 and 1651 (or the supposed list of 1661) were actually acquired by Don Gaspar. The documentary evidence is further confused because Don Gaspar sent numerous works back to Madrid from Italy before his death in 1687 (AHPM, Prot. 2.819, ff. 740-1201; El Escorial Palace Library, ms. &-IV-25). Occasionally we can trace the history of a picture, such as Veronese's Susanna and the Elders (no. 94), which Don Luis inherited from the Conde de Fuensaldaña (1651, no. 32) (The picture is probably not the work in the Prado, no. 483, which seems to have been inventoried in the royal collection in 1666). Don Gaspar's estate was heavily burdened by debts (some inherited from his father), and, to judge from letters sent by agents from Naples to his daughter and heir, his Italian possessions were in disarray (Palacio de Liria, Madrid, Alba Archive, caja 162-21). Sales were ordered in both Naples and Madrid. As we have noted in the Introduction, the Madrid almoneda alone dragged on for seven years and passed through the hands of at least two receivers (AHPM, Prot. 9.893, ff. 191-221; Prot. 9.819, ff. 1176-1180; Palacio de Liria, Madrid, Alba Archives, caja 221-2). Unfortunately, there have been no shipping records located for the period 1687-90; it is therefore difficult to know exactly which pictures were sold in Italy and which were sent to Spain after Don Gaspar's death. The Madrid almoneda is of interest both for its general historical value -- the price of silver in vellón currency is given, as well as the price of a slave -- and for the light it casts on the dispersion of art in seventeenth-century Spain. Many of the transactions in the almoneda were not, strictly speaking, sales, but rather transfers of disposable property to creditors of the estate. Thus, close relatives such as the Conde de Monterrey and the Marqués de Almarza (Don Gaspar's brothers) received pictures in payment of claims presumably generated by bequests in Don Gaspar's will (See Pita Andrade 1960a, pp. 409-410). A number of convents, including those of Santa Isabel and San Nicolás in Valladolid, received pictures, perhaps in lieu of bequests or previous obligations undertaken by the Carpios. Other creditors -- Antonio de Villanoel, Pedro de Azcona, Azcona's heirs, Isabel Casier, Gabriel de Mesa, Juan Pérez Farinas, Isabel Firmento, and Bartolomé Garrido, to name a few -- were apparently trying to collect old debts. The most unusual recipient of Don Gaspar's pictures was Pedro Rodríguez, the Carpio's gardener, who was ceded, among other works, Velázquez's Philosopher in lieu of back wages (No. 211 in the 1689 Madrid inventory (Doc. 115). The painting is now in Rouen (López-Rey 1963, no. 76, p. 147). See Pita Andrade 1952, p. 236.) One particularly important group of paintings was transferred to the royal collection in payment of claims made by the king's household (hacienda). These claims were possibly due to a type of estate tax or perhaps to debts incurred by Don Luis. Among these pictures was a set of panels by Rubens, painted as models for the Eucharist tapestries that Isabella Clara Eugenia commissioned for the Convent of the Descalzas Reales in Madrid (Prado nos. 1695-1702; the corresponding lot numbers in the 1689 inventory are 273-74, 277, 281, +11, +17, +24, and +47 -- cf. Prado 1972, pp. 587-591, and AHPM, Prot. 9.819, ff. 1176-1180). Also from Rubens' hand were a Sacra Conversazione and a Mystic Marriage of St. Catherine valued at 16,500 reales each (nos. 264 and 493). Other pieces in the group included a Nocturnal Nativity, a Flight into Egypt, and four scenes from the life of Christ by Bassano (1689 nos. +25, +39, 61-62, and 72-73, respectively; the Flight is possibly now in the Prado, no. 40, attributed to Leandro Bassano); an unidentified Pietà by Annibale Carracci (no. 180, valued at 60,000 R.); a group of flower pieces by El Teatino (that is, Daniel Seghers, nos. 394, 395, 402, 403, 404); two works by Ribera; one by Tintoretto (no. 355); five by Titian (nos. 36, 41, 55, 486, 561); and five by Veronese (nos. 371, 473, 477, 483). Of four paintings given to Van Dyck, three were of St. Rosalia (nos. 123, 276, 278) (None of these may be identified with a work in the Prado, no. 1494, since, according to Prado 1972, p. 189, that piece was in the Escorial. A second canvas by Van Dyck of this subject in the Prado (no. 2556 -- bequest of the Conde de Pradere) may, however, be one of the Carpio pieces), and the fourth work was of St. Francis in Ecstasy (no. 283).","Collectors Files:  Carpio, Gaspar de Haro y Guzmán, Marqués de Eliche y VII Marqués del","input"

The tasación was made on 26 January 1653, which would indicate the Count died in December 1652, even though the inventory is dated 25 December 1653 -- probably a typographical error for 1652.  The paintings were appraised on 10 February 1653 by Diego Valentin Díaz and Tomás de Peñasco, along with the sculptures, appraised by Pedro Salvador.  The inventory and tasación procede through the Count's palace in Valladolid, beginning in the chapel.  Approximately 40 unnumbered lots of paintings and sculpture, many of them with multiple objects.  The entries in Spaninv are based on the transcription in Garcia Chico 1946.' 3/95 changed Name of Person and Beneficiary to match García Carraffa, Beneficiary was also called Alonso Antonio Pimentel de Quiñones according do García Carraffa.","The house of Pimentel, Condes(-Duques) de Benavente, was one of the most illustrious families in Spain and maintained an exceptionally close relationship with the Hapsburg monarchs from the reign of Philip II to the end of the seventeenth century. The condado of Benavente was conceded 17 May 1398, and the ducado 28 January 1473 (According to Atienza 1959). The titles are now incorporated into the ducado of Osuna, along with the titles of the Almirante; as a consequence, many of the family archives are now found in the sección Osuna of the AHN. Because the Benavente titles included both a condado and a ducado, the Benaventes could be referred to in documents either as Condes or Duques, not to mention Conde-Duques, although (as with Olivares) the usage was generally Conde. The following genealogy of the male members of the family (with the dates of their reigns) is taken from family documents in the AHN: VIII. Don Juan Alfonso de Pimentel (reigned 1575-[1611? 1621?]); Viceroy of Naples and of Valencia; IX. Don Antonio Alfonso de Pimentel ([1611? 1621?] -- 1633); married to Doña Leonor María de Pimentel (d. 1656); X. Don Juan [Francisco] Alfonso de Pimentel y Herrera (1633-1652); XI. Don Antonio Alfonso de Pimentel (1652-1677); XII. Don Francisco Casimirio de Pimentel (1677-1709); XIII. Don Antonio Alfonso de Pimentel (1709-1743). A discrepancy exists within the AHN documents for the death of the 8th Conde-Duque. While many of the individual documents are dated from 1611-14, implying a death date of 1611, the date is also given in various documents in this series as 1621. Since the AHN documents are copies made for the Benavente family at a later date, it is possible that the numerals 2 and 1 -- which are similarly shaped in seventeenth-century calligraphy -- have been confused. Extensive documentation, miscellaneous inventories, and lists are found among the family papers now in the AHN Sección Osuna, legajos 429, 430, and 440/2 (as well as the AHPM and Palace archives); additional lists from the end of the seventeenth century may be found in AHN Sección Osuna, cartas, [legajo?] 608, cited by Morán and Checa 1985, p. 301. The documentation transcribed in this volume covers three inventories: (1) The inventory of Doña Leonor María de Pimentel, dowager Condesa de Benavente (d. 31 January 1656) widow of Don Antonio Alfonso de Pimentel, 9th Conde[-Duque] de Benavente, who had died in 1633. (Assuming that the document is correct in identifying Doña Leonor's husband as the 9th Conde, the Condesa must have been nearly ninety years old when she died, since her son was born in 1584 and had in fact already died, in 1652.) The inventory is Document 65 in this publication. (2-3) The present documents: two inventories of her son, Don Juan Francisco Alfonso de Pimentel, 10th Conde[-Duque], who apparently died in December 1652 (Published by García Chico 1946, vol. 3, part 1, pp. 388 ff.). The inventory was taken by his brother, Don Luis Pimentel, and his widow, Doña Antonia de Mendoza. The valuation was begun on 26 January 1653, which would indicate that the Conde died in December 1652, even though the inventory is dated 25 December 1653 in the document -- probably a typographical error. The paintings were appraised on 10 February 1653 by Diego Valentin Díaz and Tomás de Peñasco, along with the sculptures which were appraised by Pedro Salvador. The inventory and valuation proceed through the Conde's palace in Valladolid, beginning in the chapel. Among the tapestries is a set of 12 panels depicting the Twelve Months of the Year, valued at 9,600 reales.","Collectors Files: Benavente, Juan Alfonso de Pimentel y Herrera, 9th Conde de Luna and 10th Conde-Duque de","input"

The collection of paintings was valued on 30 January by the painter Miguel Ximénez (ff. 21-22v). The size of this collection, some 65 items in all, compares to the size of the collection of the textile merchant Cruzat y Villanueva, who owned 67 pictures in 1659 (Doc. 70). A wide range of subjects was represented; there were landscapes with mythological subjects (no. 4), mythologies painted onto mirrors (no. 30), a painting of Troy (no. 9), a Neapolitan seascape (no. 12), flowerpieces (no. 8), and still lifes (no. 5, 11, 16). The appraisal was headed by the most valuable painting in the collection, Alonso Cano's Christ of the Passion with an angel (no. 1). This picture may have been of a type representing a dead Christ with an angel, which is known in two versions by Cano now in the Prado Museum, Madrid. The theme of Christ's passion was well represented in the collection, with no less than three versions of the Ecce Homo (nos. 2, 15, 18) and a Crown of Thorns (no. 24). The only other attributed works were a painting of Christ by the contemporary court painter Francisco Rizi (no. 6), and two copies after Italian paintings of the previous century.

This document included an appraisal of his collection of nearly 70 paintings, with their values noted in reales and maravedises, but without any mention of the name of an artist-appraiser. Apart from Cruzat y Villanueva's set of 20 Neapolitan landscapes (no. 13), his entire collection comprised paintings with religious subjects. (The subjects of three paintings were unspecified, nos. 15, 16.) No fewer than 20 of the pictures were listed as Roman works (nos. 5, 9, 11, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20); since the majority of these were small paintings on copper and metal supports, they may easily have been acquired as imports on the Madrid art market. The only attributed paintings listed were by Alonso Cano (nos. 2, 8), an artist represented in the collections of other members of the merchant community at court. Cano's painting of St. Catherine (no. 2) was the most valuable picture in the collection. While two further paintings were distinguished as originals (no. 3), their authorship was not specified.","Collectors Files:  Cruzat y Villanueva, Antonio","input"

Mensa began an inventory of their estate on 3 March 1666, and had the paintings collection valued by the painter Julián González on 14 March. Given the large number of religious subjects in the collection, it is surprising that only one of them was attributed in the appraisal, a St. Luke and the Virgin by Antiveduto Gramatica (no. 23), an artist who, according to Mancini, exported paintings to Spain from Rome. The only paintings attributed to Spanish hands were examples of the minor genres: battle paintings by Juan de la Corte (no. 46), landscapes by the contemporary artist at court Juan de Solís (d.1654) (no. 37), and older fruit still lifes by Juan van der Hamen (no. 66). Other attributed pictures included the ever-popular themes of Noah's Ark (no. 6) from Bassano and the Seasons (no. 63) from the Bassano studio. A mythological painting of Mars and Venus (no. 64) was said to be copied after Titian, although this may have been mistaken for another Venetian prototype, as no such subject by Titian was recorded in Spain. However, the collection reflected an evident taste for mythological subjects, and the appraisal listed paintings of Parnassus (no. 11), Bacchus (no. 13), Diana and Mercury (no. 51), and two ordinary landscape overwindows with the Labours of Hercules (no. 65). Although Flemish paintings were extremely popular in court collections of the time, only one Flemish tavern scene was listed here (no. 62). A more unusual subject was a picture of the Three Fates(no. 24).","Collectors Files:  Villarreal, Jerónima de","input"

Paintings inventoried in the house (ff. 407v-411) and in the oratory (ff. 423-423v) were appraised by Don Simon Leal, a painter who used his more prestigious royal title of Ujier de saleta de la Reyna (ff. 433-439). The section of the appraisal which listed láminas (no. 55 ff) included paintings on metal, stone, and wooden panels, all of which were of religious subject matter. While the most valuable works in Cortavila y Sanabria's collection were generally religious paintings, there were also a number of paintings of much more modest value which had a devotional, rather than aesthetic, relevance for this collector. In this regard, the collection is entirely typical of its time. A popular format was the religious subject set in landscape, of which he owned a number of examples (nos. 29, 30, 31, 33), and in perspectival settings, of which he owned two examples (no. 26), along with six others of unspecified subjects (nos. 2, 54). The only attributed painting in the collection was a Martyrdom of St. Catherine by Juan de la Corte (no. 9); Cortavila y Sanabria appears to have been particularly devoted to this saint, since he owned four other representations of her (nos. 15, 23, 28, 65). The gods Venus (no. 24), Cupid (no. 6), and Flora (no. 27) appeared on this collector's walls, but the values attributed to these paintings in comparison to those of other works suggests that they were not the most outstanding works of the collection.","Collectors Files:  Cortavila y Sanabria, Diego de","input"

The few inventoried paintings were appraised on 16 August 1638 by the royal painter Angelo Nardi (ff. 591v-592v). Apart from 15 religious subjects, Pérez Dávila owned a picture of Laocoön (no. 11), which reveals a rather more learned aspect of his taste. He may even have been attracted to the subject because it represented a pagan priest who was killed while officiating at the altar of Neptune. While this may have been a representation of the classical sculptural group in the Vatican collections, the most famous Spanish painting of this theme was that of El Greco, which was known in a number of versions (F. Marías, El Greco y los usos de la antigüedad clásica in La visión del mundo clásico en el arte español, CSIC, VI Jornadas de Arte, 1992, pp. 178-179).","Collectors Files:  Pérez Dávila, Diego, Abad de Santa Marta de Astorga","input"

Further inventory of Pablo Justiniano's goods, ff.568-579v, Madrid 26 August 1637. Photocopy (ii) paintings inventoried at ff.572-572v.'","The inventory of the estate of the Genoese merchant Pablo Justiniano (d. 20 March 1634) was drawn up in Madrid by his brother Agustín Justiniano, beginning on 23 March 1634. While Flemish landscapes were extremely popular decoration in Madrid houses, it was less common to find listed small landscapes of an oval format, such as Justiniano's set of the months on panel (no. 3). Such works were painted by northern artists working in Rome, and one such picture appears hanging on the wall in the anonymous portrait of Sir Arthur Hopton (Meadows Museum, Dallas, Texas). Justiniano acquired his two paintings by Juan de la Corte (nos. 27 and 28), the only works to be attributed in the inventory, from the estate auction of the Marqués de Montesclaros in 1628 (Doc. 13), as he did his painting of Hercules fighting the Nemean lion (no. 29). One lot of paintings, comprising 13 religious subjects, three landscapes, and two portraits of clerics (nos. 23 and 24), were sold to Bartolomé Barrillero for the relatively small amount of some 400 reales. Barrilero was often documented buying works at estate auctions in the capital, such as that of the Duc d'Aarschot, for example. He may have dealt in paintings, keeping a small, distinguished collection which was inventoried for his marriage in 1651 (Agulló y Cobo 1981, pp. 210-211). In this document, the works of sculpture have not been included in the transcription, since these are listed among works of art which Justiniano had willed to relatives and friends. A painting of the Mystic Marriage of St. Catherine and a sculpture of the Virgin, for instance, were sent to Genoa to Justiniano's daughter, a nun, Sor María Joana Justiniano, and another of Mary Magdalene was willed to his friend Antonio Balbi (Doc. 39). Two bronze sculptures of the Infant Jesus and the Infant John the Baptist, which were made in Seville, were sent to Justiniano's two other daughters in Genoa.","Collectors Files:  Justiniano, Pablo","input"

Last day sale 13 April 1640.'","The postmortem inventory of Villanueva del Fresno's widow, Francisca Luisa Portocarrero, Marquesa de Villanueva del Fresno (d.22 December 1639), begun on the day of her death, was drawn up by her executors, the Conde de Altamira and Conde de Castrillo. Her paintings were appraised by the painter Don Juan Tellez on 5 January and 1 February 1640. These pictures were basically those that the Marquesa inherited in the partition of her husband's estate on 3 September 1637 (AHPM, Prot. 5.201, ff. 485-504),  which also included some 14 works included in her dowry. Unfortunately, the pictures listed in the document were largely anonymous, except for an attribution to el Vassal, of one of the Four Seasons (no. 66) and three Flemish works (nos. 5, 32, 73). Many of the paintings, however, were listed in her husband's valuation some five years earlier, where they appear to have been assigned higher valuations. For instance, a Juan de la Corte garden scene was appraised at 330 reales in the collection in 1635 (Doc. 20, no. 36) and at slightly less in 1640 (no. 50). In the case of the Villanueva copy of Raphael's Transfiguration, worth 300 reales in 1635 (Doc. 20, no. 54), in 1640 this was valued at only 66 reales (no. 63) because the paint was described as lifting off the panel. This particular painting is unlikely to have survived. In many cases in the following transcription, the numerical value given at the end of the item does not correspond to the written value given within the body of the entry. Also, there are instances where no numerical value is given at all. It is possible that the numerical values are related to the prices realized at the sale of the estate that immediately followed the valuation, beginning on 6 March 1640.","Collectors Files:  Villanueva del Fresno y Barcarrota, Francisca Luisa Portocarrero","input"

On 15 January 1642 he was appointed fiscal of the Council of Castile, with the expectation of becoming a member of the Council. He died in Madrid on 8 March 1642, and his inventory was drawn up by his widow, Leonor María Altamirano, with his extensive library itemized, beginning on 15 March 1642. His picture collection was appraised by the painter Antonio de Puga on 16 June 1642. It was said at the time of his death that Altamirano left his children in financial difficulty (Fayard 1982, p. 394). Altamirano was a close friend of the Duc d'Aarschot. He acted as one of the executors of his last will and testament, drawn up before the notary of the Council of Justice, and (with the permission of Philip IV) wrote a Defense of Don Felipe de Aremberg (See Biographie Nationale...de Belgique, Brussels, 1866, t.1, s.v. Arenberg, Philippe-Charles, prince-comte de', by L.Pr. Gachard, p. 399, no. 1). The inventory of his picture collection contained a portrait of the duc seated in a chair, along with a full-length portrait of Altamirano himself. The fact that these did not appear in the appraisal of his paintings suggests that they were reserved for his heirs. Altamirano also bought paintings of the Four Seasons, a portrait of Aarschot's grandfather, and a picture of Christ from Aarschot's auction (AHPM, Prot. 5.993, f. 1144, 13 September 1641; f. 1249, 18 September 1641). Another of the paintings in Altamirano's collection that came from Aarschot's collection was an unusual genre painting, A Negro Grinding Chocolate (no. 59). His taste for Flemish paintings may have been influenced by Aarschot, and he owned five large hunting scenes, a specialty of Flemish artists, whose subjects were specified in the inventory as hunts of wolves, boar, lions, deer, and a tiger. One of these was a full-sized copy of the enormous Wolf Hunt by Rubens (no. 55), the only attributed work in the inventory, which was probably the copy made by Antonio de Puga after the original owned by Aarschot. Puga, who appraised the paintings, valued this more highly than any other picture in the collection.  The bracketed information in no. 39 comes from the fuller description of the picture given in the inventory.","Collectors Files:  Altamirano, Diego de","input"

Photocopy of valuation of paintings, ff. 393-399, 24 October 1664, by Pedro de Villafranca, painter.'","Arce's collection grew steadily from 1643 to 1666. At the time of the inventory of 1643 (see Doc. 38), the collection was a modest but fairly select group of 26 paintings. There were seven works attributed to Orrente; two each given to Juan de la Corte, Collantes, Ribalta, and Ribera; a still life ascribed to Van der Hamen; and a much-valued Crucifix, said to have been painted by Navarrete. There were also several dubiously attributed pieces, such as a Titian -- Christ at the Column, valued at only 440 reales -- and a pair of classical subjects -- Leda and Psyche -- that would later be ascribed to Tintoretto. But even at this relatively early stage of his career, Arce was showing the taste for secular subjects and Italian artists that would characterize his acquisitions. Arce's tasador in 1643 was Angelo Nardi, who apparently became an important link between Arce and the Madrid art community, not to mention one of Arce's favorite artists. By 1657 (Doc. 66), Arce had acquired at least five and probably eight of Nardi's works (nos. 1, 2, 13, 14). Arce had also augmented his holdings of canvases attributed to Orrente and increased the percentage of secular subjects. Five new pictures attributed to Ribera had been acquired, along with one by Bartolomé Carducho. In both the 1643 and 1657 inventories, a number of works were left unassigned, but Arce was already displaying a concern with attribution and connoisseurship that characterized such devoted collectors as Don Gaspar de Haro. By 1664, several of the unattributed paintings from the earlier inventories were attributed, suggesting that Arce and his artistic advisors were constantly refining their appreciation of his pictures (eg. nos. 30, 31). The most extensive inventory of Arce's collection yet discovered was taken upon the occasion of his second marriage, in 1664. By this time, Arce had amassed 20 paintings attributed to Orrente and had complemented these with a Mary Magdalene given to Bassano (no. 4), which apparently hung next to it. An important Ribera, The Trinity (possibly the painting now in the Prado, no. 1069), two Heads by Massimo Stanzione, a Mark Anthony and Cleopatra by Borgianni, and a city view by Codazzi had expanded the Italian Seicento holdings, with particular emphasis on tenebrist painters. Central Italy of the previous century was represented by works attributed to Giulio Romano, Sebastiano del Piombo, and Tibaldi, along with the Netherlandish masters, Bosch and Bril. The contemporary painters of the Spanish court were also represented, including Velázquez (no. 22), Nardi (who may have been dead by this time, nos. 41-45) (According to Pérez Sánchez, Borgianni, Cavarozzi y Nardi en España, Madrid 1964, p. 29, Nardi died between 1663 and 1665), Caxés (nos. 25, 56, 116), and Vicencio Carducho (no. 33, but the entry may be a error recording the sketch by Bartolomé Carducho mentioned above). Caxés is known to have copied Correggio early in his career (Leda and the Swan, Prado no. 120 -- on loan to the Provincial Museum, Seville), so the presence of a copy after Correggio's Ecce Homo is doubly interesting. Arce's inventories are also of interest in that the valuations do not remain steady but rather fluctuate from year to year along a generally, and often steeply, inflating course. For example, Orrente's Descent from the Cross, appraised at 1,100 reales in 1643 (Doc. 38, no. 1), was appraised at 4,400 in 1664 (Doc. 75, no. 2). Indeed, over half of the readily identified works coming to the 1664 inventory from the earlier descriptions of Arce's collections show increases to at least twice -- and more often, three or four times -- the original valuations. This is in distinct contrast to the more common practice of repeating earlier appraisals at face value, as for example in the Carpio inventory of 1689. A number of non-aesthetic factors might have influenced these changes. There was both inflation of prices and devaluation of vellón currency in terms of silver during the period 1643-1664, although the 1664 inventory may have been taken after an anti-inflationary decree brought the vellón and silver currencies into parity (See Elliott 1963-70, p. 367, and the comments appended to Burke 1984, vol. 2, Document 5.65). There is also circumstantial evidence to suggest that Arce manipulated the valuation process in order to obtain a more favorable financial position in the partitions, settlements, and other negotiations surrounding the death of his first wife and his subsequent remarriage (See Burke 1984, vol. 2, Document 5.66, comparing fols. 739v and 759). For example, it would have been to Arce's advantage, at the time of his first wife's death, to obtain a low valuation for those objects in the common household (especially in her dowry or her inheritance from her first marriage) which Arce wanted to keep for himself. If the paintings were given relatively low values, then it would cost Arce much less to keep his collection together during the liquidation of the estate. At the time of Arce's second marriage, the opposite would have been true: if Arce inflated the value of the goods he was bringing to the marriage, then his (or his heirs') relative position in a future settlement would be improved. Similarly, Arce could expect to benefit from deflating the value of goods in his second wife's dowry, since the dowry and other property that a wife brought to a marriage affected the claim that she (or her heirs from a previous marriage) could make before any partition of the new common household. In fact, Arce, in 1666, accepted the paintings in his second wife's dowry only after deflating -- by 33 percent across the board -- their appraised values as given in the settlement of her first husband's estate, just a few months earlier. Arce and his appraisers may have been reacting to deflationary decrees or the real market situation, and it is always possible that the more casual attitude toward prices in royal or noble liquidations reflected uncontested settlements and a need to liquidate estates quickly. (If the Carpio almoneda of 1689 may be taken as evidence, some variation between the appraised and actual sale prices was possible.) But Arce's good financial position made an estate auction highly unlikely; whether intentional or not, the changes in the appraised prices of works in his collection were all to Arce's benefit. Fluctuations may also have implications about the relative aesthetic value of each piece or the reliability of a given attribution. For example, an anonymous Leda, paired with a Psyche at 200 and 150 reales, respectively, in 1643 (Doc. 38, nos. 18 and 19), was raised to 600 reales, versus 330 for its pendant, once it has been attributed to Tintoretto in 1664. At the same time, the modest nature of the price -- 600 reales -- stands in some contrast to the valuations placed on the works of Ribera and Orrente, and suggests that Arce's (or his appraiser's) faith in the attribution to Tintoretto was not great. A more spectacular jump -- from 176 to 700 reales -- accompanied the attribution of two pictures of Sleeping Cupids (Doc. 66, no. 15) to Luca Cambiaso in 1664 (Doc. 75, nos. 30, 31). Other paintings decline in price or merely hold their own: a Van der Hamen Still Life declines from 250 to 200 (1643, Doc. 38, no. 13; 1664, Doc. 75, no. 100) and is not even attributed in the later inventory. Van der Hamen must have seemed old-fashioned at mid-century, with Arellano and other modern still-life painters active, so the decline in price may not be remarkable; the loss of an attribution is, on the other hand, unusual in such a carefully conserved collection as Arce's. It would seem that the work had been de-attributed and simultaneously devalued. The fate of a Christ at the Column, unframed but attributed to Titian in 1643 (Doc. 38, no. 6), is more understandable. By 1664, what was presumably the same painting (Doc. 75, no. 39) had gained a frame but lost its attribution; it was valued at 500 reales -- a slight increase -- but not nearly as high as the already mentioned works by Ribera and Orrente. Finally, it should be noted that the Italian bias of Arce's collection is overwhelming. Of 76 attributed works, 13 were painted by sixteenth-century Italian artists (including El Greco). Ten or more were painted by contemporary Italians active in Italy, and another 18 were painted by contemporary Italians or painters of Italian descent working in Spain. There was one work by Ribera, and 24 more by other italianate Spaniards: that is, nearly nine out of ten attributed canvases were Italianate in style. This may have been due to the influence of the Italian-born Nardi -- and of Velázquez -- but it was an important aspect of Arce's collection from the very beginning.","Collectors Files:  Arce, Pedro de","input"

Short sale of estate ff.311-315, beginning Madrid 25 June 1636.  Estate partitioned, f.328ff. 12 August 1636.'","Cristóbal González Cossío was a royal secretary and accountant (contador de resultas) in the Contaduría general de Cuentas y Resultas, one of the two bodies concerned with administering Crown finances. His estate was inventoried by his widow, Catalina de Velasco de Villarín (her death inventory is Doc. 81), in Madrid from 16 May 1636. His collection of pictures, appraised by the painter Andrés López on 21 June, included portraits of Philip III and Queen Margarita as well as small paintings de los Reyes, probably Philip IV and his queen, a fact that suggests the collection was formed over both reigns. It is a revealing example of the taste for painting of a non-noble member of the royal administration in the first half of the seventeenth century. Unlike his noble counterparts, González Cossío was unlikely to have been able to bid for originals by the most famous Italian artists of the past of the level of those whose works adorned the royal collections. He therefore owned copies after Raphael's Madonna della sedia (no. 1), Titian (no. 2), Veronese (no. 3), and Bassano (no. 39); the relatively high values Andrés López assigned to these suggests that they were paintings of considerable artistic merit. Indeed, the copy after Raphael was the most valuable painting in the collection and was worth only slightly less than two original pictures by the contemporary Roman painter Antiveduto Grammatica (nos. 4, 23, 51), who in his maturity painted in a Caravaggesque manner. Paintings by this artist attributed in a Spanish inventory bear out the remark in Mancini's Considerazioni sulla pittura that Grammatica sent many works to Spain. It is also worth noting that two paintings in the collection had Genoese frames (nos. 5, 59).  González Cossío's Spanish pictures included paintings by Pedro de Orrente, whose two landscapes (nos. 57, 70) were valued at considerably less than his figurative painting of St. Lawrence (no. 4). Not surprisingly, the other painters represented in the collection were contemporary artists active at court. Juan de la Corte's battle paintings (no. 18) were extremely popular among court collectors. The Italian court painters Vicencio Carducho and Eugenio Caxés, who also appear to have enjoyed a thriving practice for private clients, were also represented, Carducho by an Ecce Homo (no. 13) and Caxés by three paintings, a Nativity scene on a stone tondo (no. 65) and two landscapes with religious subjects (nos. 66,67). The collection included a number of family portraits. Less than half of González Cossío's pictures were of religious subjects, but he owned only one mythological subject, a copy of the Birth of Venus after Veronese (no. 3) which appears to have been his only painting of a female nude. However, his collection included a wide range of themes. Some of the genre subjects probably provided visual pleasure for their own sake, such as flowerpieces (no. 28), landscapes, animals fighting (nos. 29, 30), and a long picture of carnival festivities (no. 78). While there were landscape paintings, González Cossío also appears to have had a particular liking for topographical subjects, which perhaps reflected his own travels in Spain, and the document listed views of Seville (no. 33), the Escorial (no. 17), Toledo (nos. 22, 25, 26), the Casa de Villegas (no. 77), and other cities (no. 34). He seems too to have had a taste for the curious, represented by four paintings of heads signifying the Seasons (no. 37), perhaps in the style of Arcimboldo, as well as a number of paintings of drunkards and buffoons (nos. 80, 83). Nine of these paintings were listed as hanging in a corridor of González Cossío's house, perhaps in imitation of the prime minister, the Conde-Duque de Olivares, who decorated the corridor leading to his study in the Alcázar with portraits of madmen and fools, where they were a constant reminder of the folly of vanity and pride among the great of this world (Elliott 1986, p. 457).","Collectors Files:  Cossío, Cristóbal González","input"

Miguel de Salamanca (d. 7 March 1658) drawn up in Madrid 11 March 1658.'","Don Miguel de Salamanca (d. 7 March 1658), knight of Santiago, came to prominence during the reign of Philip IV. He had been inspector of the army of Flanders and in 1638 entered the service of the Cardinal-Infante Don Ferdinand in Flanders as political and military advisor; his picture collection contained a full-length portrait of the cardinal-infante in military uniform by Gaspar de Crayer (no. 17). Salamanca undertook diplomatic embassies in the north on behalf of the Conde-Duque de Olivares, and in Madrid rose to become a member of the Councils of War (Consejo de Guerra) and Royal Treasury (Consejo de Hacienda). In his collection, Salamanca owned a small portrait of Olivares said to be painted by Velázquez himself (no. 27), and three copies of Velázquez portraits of the royal family: Philip IV, Queen Isabella of Borbon, and the Infante Baltasar Carlos (no. 18). Don Miguel de Salamanca began the inventory of his goods in Madrid two days after the death of his wife Costanza Pardo (d. 2 April 1655). An inventory of the family collection at their seat at Burgos, made on 15 June 1655, comprised religious subects and many tempera paintings, some of which were described as old and damaged. The valuation of Salamanca's paintings was undertaken on 12 June 1655 by Juan Carreño de Miranda, the artist from whom he commissioned a painting of St. Anthony of Padua for his chapel in the Convento de Capuchins in Madrid (Díaz del Valle, ed. 1933, p. 382; Palomino ed. 1986, p.286). It would appear that Salamanca's taste for Flemish art, as well as the bulk of his picture collection, was acquired during his time in Flanders. A painting by Jan van Eyck (no. 6), which was a gift on Salamanca's marriage, and one by Albrecht Dürer he had inherited (no. 7), were to remain as part of his estate, as was a painting attributed to Raphael (no. 5). In the inventory of 1655, the precision of the attributions, particularly to Flemish hands, is remarkable. Indeed, the detail of this document must reflect Salamanca's supervision. Although the appraiser of the collection, Juan Carreño de Miranda, was one of the most reliable connoisseurs among painter-appraisers, all the attributions of the appraisal document follow those of the inventory. Salamanca's postmortem inventory of 11 March 1658, broadly followed that of 1655, but with the significant difference that there were considerably fewer attributed paintings in the later document (AHPM, Prot. 7.151, 11 March 1658). One important addition to the collection after 1655 is recorded in the later inventory; these were 106 Flemish paintings on copper in ebony frames, whose subject matter was unspecified. Salamanca possessed a remarkable set of large paintings of founders of religious orders which were the result of collaboration among three Flemish artists: Gaspar de Crayer painting the figures, Lodewickj de Vadder the landscapes, and another hand the still-life elements. A reference to their importation from Flanders is to be found in the Libros de paso dated 30 January 1647 in which they were described as 18 Pinturas de los funadores de las Relixiones, accompanied by a painting of the Virgin (M. Morán Turina, Importaciones y exportaciones de pinturas en el siglo XVII através de los registros de los libros de pasos, Madrid en el contexto de lo hispánico, Departamento de la Historia del Arte, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Madrid, 1994, I, p. 555). An additional painting of the Spanish saint St. Peter Nolasco was a copy by Juan Carreño de Miranda of an original composition by Eugenio Caxés (no. 1). Remarkably, this was one of the very few Spanish artists identified in the collection. Salamanca also appears to have employed an unknown Spanish artist, Diego de Leiva, to complete a series of Roman paintings of the Virtues (nos. 19). The majority of the attributions in the document were to Flemish masters. Although Salamanca owned a large painting of the Virgin by Daniel Seghers (no. 3), perhaps original paintings by the greatest Flemish painters were beyond his means. The inventory listed five copies of compositions by Rubens, four of which were mythological subjects and one subject from classical history (no. 9), as well as two images of the Virgin copied from paintings by Anthony van Dyck (nos. 2 and 4). Salamanca's nine animal and bird paintings by Frans Snyders testify to the abiding popularity of such subjects by this master among upper-class collectors in Madrid (nos. 8 and 13). Salamanca's Flemish flower paintings were also typical of the taste for such expensive imports by northern specialists among collectors at the Spanish court, including the king himself, and which led the Spanish flower painter Juan de Arellano to exploit this market with his own versions of Flemish prototypes. Two of Salamanca's flowerpieces were original and highly valued collaborative festoon paintings by Daniel Seghers and Frans Ijkens (no. 14), and there was a flowerpiece on copper by Seghers (no. 20). Another festoon with a scene of the Rape of Europa was a copy of a Seghers original by Cornelis Schut (no. 15), while three further examples of Seghers pictures in the collection were anonymous copies (nos. 24, 25) and there was a copy of a festoon by Brueghel (no. 16). Five of these paintings appear to have formed a set, the canvas of the Brueghel copy even folded over to make it the same size as the four other flowerpieces (nos. 13-15). Two paintings of flowers in Talavera pots were probably Spanish pictures (no. 29). Salamanca's collection also contained Flemish landscape paintings, the most distinguished of which were two by the specialist Joos de Momper (nos. 12 and 31).","Collectors Files:  Salamanca, Miguel de","input"

The first evaluation of the paintings was made by Francisco de Herrera the Younger and Andreas Schmidt (who signed himself, Andrés de Smidt), beginning 2 January 1675 (fols. 419-39).  There were also statues of importance (469v-472r) and a library of 81 titles (fols. 469v-73).  Among the statues was a St. Joseph and the Christ Child de mano de pereda (Antonio Pereda?; fol. 469v, no. 4), a varnished wood Christ Child (470v, no. 16), and a Christ of unpainted wood (Sin encarnacion, 471r, no. 36).  Herrera and Schmidt say that, because of the brevity of the appraisal process -- only three days, 2-4 January -- it would be acceptable to reduce the prices by one-third.  The estate was in fact re-appraised, after the almoneda had begun, by Antonio de Pereda, who in most cases simply reduced the prices by the one-third suggested by Herrera and Schmidt (5 February 1675, fols. 499v-510).  The documents make clear that the appraised prices were simply too high for the pictures to sell (y habiendose Vendido algunas Las que an quedado Estan muy Subidos de tassa Sin poder [tener?] Salida de ellos).  Among the purchasers at the almoneda were the Almirante de Castilla and Antonio de Pereda himself.' [check title, Vergara cites Conde de Molina de Herrera]","The postmortem inventory of D. Antonio Mesía de Tovar, Conde de Molina (d. 30 November 1674), was drawn up by D. Francisco Ruíz, royal secretary in Madrid from 6 December 1674, with his extensive picture collection inventoried on 21 December (ff. 386-397) (Published in part by Saltillo 1953, pp. 230-31). The valuation of moveable goods (bienes muebles) began on 2 January 1675 (ff. 419-498v), with the pictures valued between 2 and 4 January 1675 (ff. 419v-439) by the painters Don Francisco de Herrera and Andrés Smidt. After the public sale of Molina's goods had opened, the majority of the paintings remained unsold because of the high reserve values set by these artists. Consequently a third painter, Antonio de Pereda, reappraised the works and lowered their original values to ensure their sale (ff. 499-510, 5 February 1675). Molina's sale was resumed on 21 January 1675, and attracted some of the most distinguished connoisseurs of the time, including the Almirante de Castilla and the Condestable de Castilla. Molina's collection boasted paintings attributed to famous old masters of the sixteenth century -- the Venetian artists Titian, Veronese, Tintoretto, and Palma and, perhaps, a painting by Correggio (no. 91), as well as a valuable Dürer (no. 83) -- all names that had assumed canonical status in the minds of connoisseurs in the period. Only two Spanish artists were mentioned, Juan Bautista del Mayno (no. 76) and the battle painter Juan de Toledo (no. 103), whose painting was worth half of one by Borgognone (no. 46). This was, however, one of the most important collections of northern paintings in the capital. More than 20 Flemish artists are listed in Molina's inventory, and the collection even included portraits by the English artist Sir Peter Lely (nos. 113, 135). The fact that the inventory discriminates between so many northern hands and identifies a range of foreign artists -- some of which are difficult to identify today -- reflects Molina's connoisseurship. Molina only owned copies after works by Rubens (no. 36) and Van Dyck (no. 172), but had originals by very famous masters of the caliber of David Teniers the Younger (nos. 48, 155) and Velvet Brueghel, including an important set of four paintings on copper of the Last Judgement, Heaven and Hell, and The Flood worth nearly 10,000 reales (no. 162). Molina appears to have had a taste for small copper panel paintings by Flemish artists in the so-called minor genres. Thus his collection included many Flemish landscapes painted by masters such as Jacques d'Arthois and Adriaen Pietersz van de Venne, as well as Dutch and Italian examples. The Italian paintings included landscapes by Francesco Banelli (no. 17), active in the early part of the century. There were also Flemish paintings of the Seasons (no. 137), still lifes, and flower paintings and garlands by well-known specialists in this field such as Jan van Kessel (I), Jan Linsen,  and Frans Ijkens, as well as ten bird still lifes by an unidentified artist, Allaert, who was also a Dominican priest. Genre scenes in the collection included one by Adriaen Brouwer (no. 13), and also a valuable picture described as a sale of paintings (no. 148), which might have depicted a painting gallery.","Collectors Files:  Molina, Antonio Messia de Tovar, Conde de","input"

Burke adds:  'Cuellar's career is in many ways typical of the hidalgo courtier class and often parallels that of Diego Velázquez;  the relatively small size of his estate indicates that he was devoting a large proportion of his assets to picture collecting.'","The collection and social history of Jerónimo de Cuellar are analyzed in the Introduction. One may only repeat the observation that Cuellar's career, especially when viewed in parallel with those of Velázquez and Pedro de Arce, describes the path taken by many upwardly mobile non-noble families in the seventeenth century. A bourgeois Spaniard could use a career at court (that is, membership in the so-called courtier class) to certify his origins in the gentry and gain entry into the petty nobility, usually through knighthood in a military order, for himself or a son. One should also point out the strong role that art collecting played in the social mimicry attendent upon social ambitions. For example, the relatively small size of Cuellar's estate indicates that he was devoting a large proportion of his assets to collecting pictures and tapestries. Although this may have been due in part to his personal interests, one may assume that it must have had some social function as well. The inventory and valuation of the estate of Don Jerónimo de Cuellar, member of the Consejo de Su Magestad y Su Secretario de la Cámara y Estado de Castilla were drawn up by his widow and heir, Doña Gerónima de Velasco y Angulo, in Madrid beginning 26 January 1674.  The paintings were inventoried beginning 19 April 1674 (ff. 110-115v), with the valuation of goods, by Matías de Torres, painter, (ff. 119-126) dated from 31 May 1674. Tapestries and rugs are also listed (ff. 127-131v). Internal evidence suggests that the inventory and the valuation are both incomplete, although no folios are missing from the protocol.","Collectors Files:  Cuéllar, Jerónimo","input"

The collection of paintings was valued by the painter Matías Pastor on 22 March (ff. 334v-340). Because Galaretta Osarez was secretary of the Council of War, some pictures in his portrait collection represented key individuals in Spanish foreign policy in the Netherlands. These included the Conde-Duque de Olivares (no. 27), the Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand (no. 40), the governor of the Netherlands, Francisco de Moncada, 3rd Marqués de Aytona, (no. 31), Alonso Pérez de Vívero, 3rd Conde de Fuensaldaña and Gobernador de las armas del rey in Flanders (no. 28), and the commander-in-chief of the Spanish Army of Flanders Ambrosio Spínola, 1st Marqués de los Balbases (no. 29). In this context, it is also easy to understand the attraction to Galaretta Osarez of his series of 12 tempera paintings of battles and sieges (no. 20) and perhaps the two ship paintings (nos. 59, 61). The only attributed paintings were both copies, one a Virgin and Child with many angels after Van Dyck (no. 53) and another copy after a portrait of Charles V by Titian (no. 22). Galaretta Osarez owned a number of paintings of religious subjects with festoons and garlands of flowers (nos. 8, 9, 16, 66), which appear to have become more popular in the second half of the century. He also enjoyed the secular genres of flower painting (nos. 51, 57) and still lifes (no. 47, 62). A number of the paintings were genre pictures with figures, listed as bodegones with fish (no. 33) and crab (no. 41), and a vegetable stall (no. 35). A pair of paintings represented a fisherman and vegetable vendor (nos. 45, 46). One painting of an old man signified Winter (no. 67). Only one painting, however, was explicitly described as a mythological subject (no. 54).","Collectors Files:  Galarreta y Osarez, Francisco de","input"

The paintings collection was appraised by the painter and member of the Flemish royal guard of archeros, Felipe Diriksen, on 28 October 1648 (ff. 283v-285v). The picture collection had barely altered from the time his paintings were listed in an inventory of capital drawn up on the occasion of his marriage in 1624 (AHPM, Prot. 3.266, ff. 598-602v, 12 August 1624; cited in J. López Navío, Velázquez tasa los cuadros de su protector Don Juan de Fonseca, Archivo Español de Arte, 34 (1961), pp. 62-63, no. 17). Galló de Escalada's paintings included portraits of the royal family (nos. 1-3, 13) which were a prerequisite of the collections of members of the royal administration.. He is recorded owing the painter Andrés Ruiz 36 ducats for three unspecified portraits in the artist's testament of 1622 (AHPM, Prot. 4.323, ff. 168-177, 15 September 1622). Interestingly, the most highly valued of these was a full-length of Philip III (no. 1), during whose reign this collector may have risen to prominence at court. In the inventory of 1624, this was said to depict the king in the costume in which the Portuguese Cortes swore allegiance to him on his visit to Lisbon in 1619 (AHPM, Prot. 3.266, f. 600, Un Retrato del rey don felipe t.o nro s.r con su marco dorado y negro bestido del traxe con que le juraron en portugal. This portrait, therefore, was probably a version of a portrait of the king by Bartolomé González that hung in the Alcázar's New Room (Orso 1986, p. 47). The only religious paintings were attributed to Pedro de Orrente (no. 5) and a copy after Titian (no. 30). A series of four paintings of the Seasons were said to be copies after Orrente (no. 24). Galló de Escalada clearly enjoyed the paintings of Juan van der Hamen, by whom he owned eleven fruit still lifes (no. 4), also listed in the inventory of 1624, and two flowerpieces (no. 22). In addition there were nine other flowerpieces (nos. 8 and 17), 16 flowerpieces painted on lozenges (no. 10), and six still lifes (no. 12). Although all of these latter paintings were listed anonymously, in the inventory of 1624 the lozenge-shaped flowerpieces were said to be Flemish, as were five fruit still lifes. A less innocuous painting was the single mythological subject in the collection, a painting of Venus (no. 7) which undoubtedly represented a nude female figure.","Collectors Files:  Galló de Escalada Olaso y Manrique, Garci","input"

Ana Maria de Peñaranda (d. 13 July 1665) drawn up by her husband Thomas Sánchez.  Photocopy of valuation of paintings 12 August 1665 by Francisco Gutierrez Cavello, painter.'","In the valuation of the estate of Tomás Sánchez, whose profession was unspecified in the documents, and Ana María de Peñaranda (d. 13 July 1665) on the occasion of her death, their collection of paintings was valued by the painter Francisco Gutiérrez Cavello on 12 August 1665. The most remarkable feature of this appraisal is the large number of paintings attributed to Juan Bautista de la Cotera and Manuel de Molina, who were both prominent artists in their own time, but whose works remain unknown today. Díaz del Valle cited Molina in his notes on painting in 1658, when he was seventy years old, and commented that he was a prolific painter who was represented in many private collections at court (Díaz del Valle, ed. 1933, p. 373). Indeed, there were 18 religious subjects by Molina in the collection of Sánchez and Peñaranda. Thirteen paintings by De la Cotera in the collection reflected this artist's greater versatility and included religious subjects, perspective paintings and battles, and a painting of The Fall of Troy. This artist is documented working in Madrid between 1604 and 1648; in the documents he styled himself pintor de Su Majestad (Agulló Cobo 1978, p. 53; Agulló Cobo 1981, pp. 61-62). Judging from the number and value of the paintings in the collection by Juan Antonio de Frías y Escalante (ca. 1633-ca. 1670), Tomás Sánchez and his wife may have acted as important private patrons of this young artist. No foreign artists were identified in the document, and the only imported paintings listed were Flemish paintings on copper of floral festoons (no. 25) and unspecified subjects (no. 20). Two religious pictures were said to be copies (nos. 17, 23), but the source of their compositions is not given. The painter-appraiser of this collection, Francisco Gutiérrez, specialized in subject paintings in perspectival settings, and the collection included two of his own pictures of the Marriage of the Virgin and the Visit of the Queen of Sheba to Solomon (no. 30). These were probably multi-figured compositions similar to works of the same subjects by the artist now at Villagarcía de Campos (Angulo Iñiguez and Pérez Sánchez 1983, pp. 72-73). In a blatant act of self-admiration, Gutiérrez made them the most highly valued pictures in the whole collection, worth far more than other perspectival paintings in the appraisal.","Collectors Files:  Peñaranda, Ana María de","input"

The inventoried paintings were valued on 15 April 1654 by the royal painter Angelo Nardi, whose attributions followed those of the inventory exactly. This was essentially a collection of religious paintings; some of the works of comparatively low value were probably of more devotional than aesthetic importance. By far the most valuable painting was an Immaculate Conception by the royal painter of Italian extraction, Eugenio Caxés (no. 2), and Nardi's high valuation of this work suggests sincere admiration for the qualities of his colleague's art. Two pictures by Pedro de Orrente were also valued at appreciable sums (nos. 3, 8), as was an anonymous original Last Supper (no. 4), whose value may also have reflected the large number of figures required to represent such a subject. The only paintings of secular subjects listed in the collection were four coppers of battles (no. 25) and a set of 18 heads of Roman emperors (no. 23), which were of negligible value and, if not inherited, were probably acquired much earlier in the century. However, the 17 small paintings on metal depicting hermit saints in landscapes were examples of a type of devotional painting that never went out of fashion throughout the seventeenth century.","Collectors Files:  Fernández de Vega, Luis","input"

The paintings were valued by Joseph de Salazar, painter. The document is a representative example of the more modest collections of non-noble individuals at court, who, despite their small holdings of paintings, appear nevertheless to have invested in some high-quality paintings by contemporary masters. Heading the valuation was a Virgin and Child painted by Alonso Cano (no. 1). This was the most valuable of the pictures and was, most probably, far superior in quality to most of the other paintings in the collection, all of which were listed anonymously. It may have formed the centerpiece of Ruíz de Miranda's small gallery or have been a focus for private devotions. Four paintings of the Furies (no. 20) are likely to have been copies of Titian's famous paintings of the Four Condemned that hung in the Madrid Alcázar. These were not, however, particularly valuable works and declined considerably in value in successive appraisals of the collection in 1674 and 1678.","Collectors Files:  Álvarez de Pedrosa, Juana","input"

A number of paintings were sold privately from the estate to the Duque de Osuna for 25,000 reales. Despite Marquez's religious calling, his collection did include three paintings of the story of Diana (no. 24) and a picture which they call the bachanal (no. 15), perhaps a copy of Titian's Andrians (Madrid, Prado). More innocuous decorative subjects included still lifes, bodegones, and a set of eight valuable octagonal flower paintings (no. 3). There was a battle scene listed (no. 27), but only four landscapes, which represented the theme of the Four Seasons (no. 16). The document was headed by a set of eight scenes from Christ's Passion in perspectival settings painted by Viviano Codazzi (no. 1). The other attributed works in the collection were also religious subjects, the highest-valued of which was an Ecce Homo by Luis de Morales (no. 34), followed by saints painted by Ribera (no. 2) and unframed paintings of the Virgin and Christ by Juan de Carreño (no. 6), which Herrera, perhaps pointedly, valued lowest of all among the attributed Spanish pictures, at 150 reales apiece. One of the most valuable paintings in the collection was a representation of St. Theresa (no. 29), which appears to have decorated Márquez de Escalante's cell.","Collectors Files:  Márquez de Escalante, Joseph","input"

Phelipe de Silva, painter.'","On the death of the wealthy jeweler Joseph de Lezana, tasador de joyas, his small painting collection was appraised by one Felipe de Silva, painter, on 10 January 1681. While Lezana's copy of Titian's Martyrdom of St. Lawrence (no. 2) is unremarkable in the context of the taste for Venetian old master paintings of the time, the subject is one of those least copied among Titian's works represented in Spanish collections at this time (See Doctor Alonso Cortés 1632, Doc. 17, no. 84). A curious aspect of the collection is the presence of unfinished paintings by Mateo Cerezo and Alonso Cano (no. 9). There were six works listed by Cerezo; an unframed Visitation (no. 12), four pictures specified as unfinished (nos. 3, 8, 10, 14), and one called Un borriquilla which was perhaps a sketch (no. 11). Lezana's most highly valued painting was a Nativity by Cerezo that was framed, although unfinished (no. 3), while two other unfinished Cerezos (nos. 8, 14) and the painting by Cano (no. 9) were without frames. Mateo Cerezo died prematurely in 1666; Lezana may have ordered works from him that were left unfinished on his death, or he may have bought these from the painter's estate. Although the degree of lack of finish is not specified, Lezana clearly did not have the pictures finished by another hand, and he appears to have displayed them in this state for at least fifteen years. This may suggest some positive appreciation of their unfinished qualities, which is not inconceivable in the context of the taste for the painterly style at court after the death of Velázquez.","Collectors Files:  Lezcana, José de","input"

Photocopy of valuation of paintings, 22 January 1670, by Don Sebastian de Herrera, painter.  Partition of estate, 3 March 1670.'","The postmortem inventory of Don Blasco de Loyola, a Basque knight of the Order of Santiago and comendador of Villarubia de Ocaña, was drawn up by his widow Ursola Veno del Rey and brother-in-law, Doctor Don Joseph Veno del Rey, and was opened in Madrid on 21 October 1669 (Loyola's valuation was previously published in J.L. Barrio Moya, , El hidalgo guipuzcoano Don Blasco de Loyola y el inventario de sus bienes, Cuadernos de Cultura, no. 10 (1987), pp. 83-90). He was protected by the Jesuit Father Nithard, confessor of Queen Mariana of Austria, and was an excellent bureaucrat, whose loyalty and efficiency allowed him to rise in the administrative hierarchy to achieve great social distinction. Loyola was Secretario del Despacho from 1655, in direct contact with the king and his prime minister (as Jerónimo de Villanueva had been before him). He became secretary of the Despacho Universal during the regency of Queen Mariana (from 1665) and was consequently also secretary of the Junta de Gobierno, which met daily during the minority of Charles II. At his death, Loyola was also a member of the Consejo de Guerra and the Cámara de Indias. However, his main governmental office was Secretario de Estado, an office he had occupied since April 1662, with particular responsibility for Italy (in 1662, and between October 1665 and October 1669) and for the North (August 1662-October 1665). Loyola's collection of paintings was appraised by the painter Don Sebastian de Herrera on 22 January 1670. Although the collection was not as large as those of two other Secretaries of State, Diego de la Torre (Docs. 91 and 92) and Bartolomé de Legasa (Doc. 100), it was wide ranging in subject matter. Although most of the paintings were of religious subjects, there was also a painting of the Abduction of Europa (no. 19) and landscapes with nymphs (no. 2), a Flemish tavern scene (no. 30), and the Senses of Sight and Hearing (no. 36). It is surprising, however, that the document mentions no portraits. Heading the document was the only attributed work, the Judgement of Solomon by Rubens (no. 1), valued at 1,000 reales. (This was, perhaps, a version of the painting of this subject from Rubens' studio, which exists in the Prado, Madrid, and Statens Museum for Kunst, Copenhagen.) While Loyola probably admired this as a great work of art in its own right, its author and subject matter, concerning wisdom and the exercise of a difficult judgement, may have held a particular relevance for a minister who dealt with Flemish affairs. Moreover, a number of other paintings represented heroes of the Old Testament: there were two paintings of Judith and Holofernes (nos. 8, 13), two paintings of David with the head of Goliath (nos. 10, 27) a pair of pictures of David's triumph (no. 37), and a painting of Jael and Sisera (no. 11).","Collectors Files:  Loyola, Blasco de","input"

Photocopy of valuation of paintings by Antonio Van de Pere, 6 March 1679, numbered 302-437.  Sale of goods begins 17 April 1679. Partition of estate, Madrid 9 October 1679.'","The postmortem combined inventory and valuation of the estate of Don Bartolomé de Legasa (d. 9 February 1679), a knight of the Order of Santiago, was drawn up by his widow Estefania de Espeleta y Verio and was begun on 23 February 1679. (Legasa's inventory was published verbatim, with books and other goods in J.L. Barrio Moya, , El inventario de los bienes del hidalgo navarro Don Bartolomé de Legasa, consejero de Estado del Rey Carlos II (1679), Letras de Deusto, vol. 18, no. 42 (1988), pp. 177-186.) Legasa was appointed as Secretario de Estado with responsibility for Italy in 1675, and from 1676 until the time of his death managed the secretariat of Italy exclusively. The collection of some 96 paintings was appraised on 6 March by the Flemish painter Antonio van de Pere. Uncharacteristically, the collection appears to have contained no portraits. At the head of the document was a large Immaculate Conception by the royal painter Angelo Nardi (no. 1). A further five paintings by this artist (nos. 17, 18, 23, 24, 45) would suggest that he was a favorite of Legasa. The only other Spanish painters mentioned by name were Pedro de Orrente (nos. 14, 20) and the younger artist and flower specialist Juan de Arellano, who had painted a garland picture (no. 49). The collection also contained copies after the legendary old masters Raphael (no. 46) and Bassano (no. 22). Legasa owned a set of Flemish copies after Snyders hunting scenes (no. 2), perhaps in direct imitation of the grand collections of the king and his aristocrats, who sought expensive originals by this artist. They nevertheless formed a distinguished and valuable group of works in the collection, and must have made an extremely impressive display if they were hung together as the decoration of one room. Two of Legasa's genre paintings depicted Flemings and were most probably northern works (nos. 4, 36). The most highly valued painting in Legasa's entire collection, a large Venus and Adonis (no. 40), worth 3,300 reales, was also Flemish and was his only mythological narrative. There were six landscapes with ruins (nos. 42, 43) which may have depicted classical buildings, and representations of the classical subjects of Cleopatra (no. 8) and the Suicide of Seneca (no. 39). The story of Seneca's suicide illustrated the popular belief in stoicism among many educated individuals in the seventeenth century, and paintings of this subject by Rubens and assistants were in the collections of the Marqués de Leganés and the Buen Retiro (Díaz Padrón 1975, pp. 339-340, no. 3048). Seneca's probity and austerity would have made him an admired model for ministers of state such as Legasa.","Collectors Files:  Legasa, Bartolomé de","input"

Nardi's valuation was headed by six paintings by El Greco appraised as a single entity in the collection. These were followed by a number of religious subjects, including four paintings of the Ecce Homo (nos. 8, 9,15). The secular subjects were listed separately, beginning with a series of 17 landscapes by a painter nicknamed el Bastardo (no. 18). Clavijo's occupation as secretary to the Consejo de la Inquisition perhaps explains the presence of only one mythological subject (no. 19) in the collection, as well as official royal portraits of the king, queen, and Prince Baltasar Carlos (nos. 35). However, Clavijo's 42 portraits of popes (no. 32) was a rather old-fashioned set of images by this date. The collection contained a number of conventional secular images, such as the two sets of the Seasons (nos. 21, 25), fruit still lifes (no. 23), and Flemish landscapes (no. 30). There were also less common subjects, such as the pair of paintings representing Lent and Carnival (nos. 20), perhaps depicting still-life objects appropriate to these times of year, and a painting of carnival festivities (no. 31). Indicative perhaps of this collector's serious and moralizing cast of mind, there was a small painting of a book (no. 34), perhaps symbolic of the vanity of learning, and a small Vanitas painting listed by its Spanish seventeenth-century term a desengaño or undeceiving of the world (no. 26).","Collectors Files:  Melgarejo, Magdalena","input"

The paintings (ff. 861-866v) were appraised by Antonio Pereda.  Many of the works can be traced back to the inventory or valuation of Monterrey's husband (Docs. 57 and 58), though with some items described slightly differently. For example, Giuseppe Cesari (Cavalier d'Arpino)'s drawing of two angels in the 1653 inventory (Doc. 57, no. 96) is changed to two figures of Icarus in the subsequent valuation (Doc. 58, no. 99), but changed back to angels here (no. 35).","Collectors Files:  Monterrey, Leonor María de Guzmán, Condesa de","input"

The collection of paintings was relatively small and no artists are mentioned, but there was a surprisingly wide range of subjects. Mythological subjects such as Venus and Adonis, Diana and Actaeon, Europa, Andromeda, etc., were the most numerous, and there were also a few scenes from classical history, including Cleopatra and Roman Charity (Cimon and Pero). The religious themes were limited primarily to Old Testament subjects, implying that the conde was collecting them for their aesthetic or even thematic value rather than as objects of devotion.   Aside from such historical paintings, however, there were also landscapes, pictures with chickens and singing birds, a marine scene and a number of portraits, mostly of family members. Since we do not have the valuations for the collection, it is difficult to determine how important the individual paintings were, but their description causes us to regret that we do not know more.","Collectors Files:  Sastago, Enrique de Aragón, Conde de","input"

Seven other paintings were listed as Italian and included two mythologies (nos. 2 and 3), a genre painting of a woman with a turkey (no. 2), and an allegory of Vanitas (no. 3). The descriptions of the three others are too imprecise to be certain of the subjects; they were listed as a woman at the clavichord (no. 1), a nude man and woman with two swans and two dogs (no. 1), and two figures with rabbits (no. 3).

Photocopy of paintings inventoried 13 October 1661.'","Don Antonio Carnero (d. 2 October 1661) began his secretarial career at the court of Brussels and entered the service of the Conde-Duque de Olivares in 1622 as one of his secretaries, also becoming secretary to the king. Carnero was the private secretary closest to Olivares, and showed his continued loyalty even after the latter's disgrace in 1643 (Elliott 1986, pp. 67, 286). By the time of his death, he had risen to become a knight of the Order of Santiago and was Philip IV's last Secretario de Estado, appointed in October 1660. His postmortem inventory, begun on 5 October, was drawn up by his brother-in-law, Don Iñigo López de Zárate, a member of the Consejo de Estado and secretary of the Consejo Supremo de Italia. The appraisal of the estate was drawn up by Carnero's son, D. Alonso Carnero y Zárate, with his paintings collection valued on 17 September 1662 by Francisco de Burgos Mantilla, painter. At the time of Carnero's marriage to Ana María López de Zárate in 1631, he drew up an inventory of his capital, which included a small number of pictures comprising three religious subjects, eight landscapes, and two portraits (AHPM, Prot. 2.052, ff. 1016-1025v, 12 May 1631). At the time of Carnero's death, the collection had grown to nearly 100 works. Carnero's collection of portraits included family members, royalty, full-lengths of Philip IV and Queen Isabella (no. 34), and two half-length images of his patron, the Conde-Duque de Olivares (no. 27). Twenty-seven religious pictures were listed in Carnero's oratory chapel. Moreover, the religious subject matter of the paintings from the other rooms in Carnero's house suggests a considerable degree of piety in his taste, with only one mythological subject listed (no. 38). A number of large paintings may have been grouped together by subject matter to form a series of images of the Life of Christ (nos. 6-10), consisting of two pairs of pictures. A Crucifixion on a small panel appeared to be by Titian (no. 53), but was valued at 100 reales less than a large copy of Raphael's Madonna of the Fish (Madrid, Prado) (no. 2). Another copy of this famous painting, perhaps the same one, was in the collection of Diego de la Torre in 1674 (Doc. 91, no. 9 and Doc. 92, no. 3). A Christ Child with the Infant St. John the Baptist was qualified as a well made copy after a Rubens prototype, and Carnero also owned two pairs of copies of Titian's Ecce Homo and Mater Dolorosa, the better of which was hung in his chapel.","Collectors Files:  Carnero, Antonio","input"

Pinturas libres.'","Don Francisco González Cossío de la Hoz was a Spanish army captain (maestre de campo), and a knight of the Order of Santiago, who was also a comendador of the order and enjoyed income from the rents of one of its benefices (encomiendas). He was probably related to the royal secretary Cristóbal González Cossío whose picture collection was appraised in 1666 (Doc. 22). Don Francisco's postmortem inventory was begun on 5 November 1671, and his paintings collection appraised on 10 and 14 December by the painter Gil Fredrique, whose name suggests an artist of northern origin. As the document makes clear, many of the pictures remained entailed to the estate of the deceased and had vinculado painted onto them. Fredrique's valuation was headed by six original Flemish paintings of towns in Flanders (no. 1), which González Cossío may well have visited in his military service and which were entailed to his estate. While the series of 12 Flemish paintings on copper of the Passion of Christ (no. 8) may have been a relatively common type of painting in contemporary collections, works by Flemish primitives were rarer, and González Cossío could boast a work by Rogier van der Weyden (no. 34). It is difficult to identify the prototype for González Cossío's copy after Titian, described as a picture of a young man (majico) and some women (no. 89). The probability that two mythological paintings representing the Abduction of Europa and the Judgement of Paris (no. 20) were original paintings by Veronese is reflected in their high valuation and the fact that they too were entailed to the estate. This collector was not shy about owning subjects from classical mythology, probably depicting female nudes. Apart from the two pictures by Veronese, seven mythologies were painted on metal supports (nos. 16, 32, 94), and a further six paintings were listed merely as fables (nos. 96, 106). Among the more innocuous subjects, the collection contained 19 flower paintings, including Spanish, Italian, and Flemish examples. There were six flowerpieces signed by the court specialist Juan de Arellano (no. 9), nine Italian works (no. 12), and two Flemish paintings of baskets of flowers (no. 10), which were listed as originals in the inventory but which the discriminating eye of the Flemish painter-appraiser judged to be copies. There were some 34 still lifes in the collection, whose subject matter in many cases was specified in the document. González Cossío, for instance, owned two still-life paintings of vessels and sugar cane by the Madrid still-life painter Antonio Ponce (no. 28) and three fruit still lifes by Juan Fernández El Labrador (nos. 14, 71). Reflecting the esteem court collectors always felt for the best works of Labrador, his small picture of bunches of grapes and apricots (no. 71) was appraised at some four times the value of the pair by Ponce, and a curious set of eight Arcimboldesque Seasons represented as faces composed of fruit, flowers, and fish (no. 100). González Cossío's collection included two sets of royal portraits (nos. 29, 64) and various other royal portraits listed separately. In one group of portraits of popes and other persons, a painting of the Conde-Duque de Olivares by Velázquez (no. 110) was singled out as a distinctive image. A curiosity in the collection was a long painting of hands in different positions (no. 38), which suggests an artist's study.","Collectors Files: González Cossío de la Hoz, Francisco","input"

Mardones showed pride in his family in a series of ancestral portraits (no. 4) and a picture of his coat of arms (no. 38). Although Mardones' profession or title is not indicated in the document, a number of portraits of the Spanish royal family (nos. 5, 19, 33) suggest that he may have been employed in some royal office. Mardones owned two copies after religious paintings by Titian, an Ecce Homo (no. 21) and a St. Sebastian (no. 32). While the ownership of copies of Venetian old master paintings was not unusual, it is perhaps more surprising that the attributed Spanish paintings in the collection were also copies. There were three copies after saints by Antonio de Pereda (no. 1), and in the oratory there was an Ecce Homo copied after Vicencio Carducho (no. 50), and an Entombment after Eugenio Caxés (no. 66). The only other author noted by Carreño was Annibale Carracci, from whom Mardones' copy of a Descent from the Cross derived (no. 51). This painting hung in Mardones' chapel, as did, it appears, a small Vanitas painting of a skull (no. 69). While a head of a poor man was said to be an original painting (no. 39), Carreño did not specify a reason for this observation. One of Mardones' mythological paintings was an Abduction of Europa (no. 18), which, by this date, was described as old and in poor condition. The other of the Charms of [the Sorceress] Medea (no. 31) was a very unusual subject in collections of the period. Unfortunately, a relatively valuable painting of the Rape of the Sabine Women (no. 23) was listed anonymously in Carreño's evaluation.","Collectors Files:  Mardones, Antonio de","input"

[On 31 August 1667 Carreño certified that he valued paintings for the public sale, but this valuation not given].  Sale of goods beginning Madrid 30 June 1667.  Partition of estate from 13 April 1669.'","The widow of Cristóbal González Cossío, Catalina Velasco de Villarín, died thirty years after her husband, and her postmortem inventory was drawn up in Madrid from 23 August 1666. The paintings collection was inventoried on 28 August and appraised on 7 September 1666 by the royal painter Juan Carreño de Miranda. After the public sale of some pictures in 1636, and the partition of her husband's estate, Velasco de Villarín was left with a small collection of some 40 paintings, most of which were listed in the inventory of 1636 (see Doc. 22). Thus, paintings by Eugenio Caxés -- including a copy of a St. Francis by the artist (Doc. 81, no. 6) which was anonymous in 1636 (Doc. 22, no. 7) -- Pedro de Orrente, Antiveduto Grammatica, and the copy after Raphael appear in the valuation of 1666. However, Carreño has added a number of new attributions to these works. A small painting of Velasco de Villarín's name saint, St. Catherine (no. 20), is here given to one Martínez the Elder. A retablo with Christ, the Virgin, St. John the Evangelist, and Mary Magdalene, which was anonymous in 1636 (Doc. 22, no. 55) was attributed to Luis de Morales (El Divino) by Carreño (Doc. 81, no. 18), and its value had risen from 80 reales to 500 reales. More interesting still, a Last Supper that was anonymous in 1636 (Doc. 22, no. 72) was said to be a copy of Leonardo da Vinci's famous fresco in Milan by the Valencian artist Francisco Ribalta (Doc. 81, no. 19). An Immaculate Conception by Jusepe Leonardo (Doc. 81, no. 23), which is listed only in the document of 1666, appears to be one of the few paintings Catalina Velasco de Villarín acquired after her husband's death. While the value of the paintings seem to have increased in Carreño's appraisal, any such comparison would have to take into account inflation between 1636 and 1666. In the case of a painting by Pedro de Orrente, Carreño corrected a subject listed as Jacob's Slave in 1636 (Doc. 22, no. 70) to Abraham's Slave, meaning Hagar, and raised its value from 88 reales to 550 reales (Doc. 81, no. 12). The most remarkable change in value, however, concerns two paintings by Antiveduto Grammatica. While an Annunciation by this artist was valued at 300 reales in 1636 (Doc. 22, no. 51), Carreño believed it a school piece which he valued at 1500 reales (Doc. 81, no. 5). Another work by Grammatica listed with no subject description in 1636 at 300 reales (Doc. 22, no. 52) was an original Flight into Egypt and was worth 2200 reales in 1666 (Doc. 81, no. 4). Carreño, however, thought much less of the Raphael copy which was so highly esteemed (at 550 reales) in 1636 (Doc. 22, no. 1), possibly because of its condition rather than its quality; this declined in value in 1666 to 300 reales (Doc. 81, no. 28).","Collectors Files:  Velasco de Villarín, Catalina","input"

Antonia Maria de Arce Calderón (d. 22 February 1673) drawn up by her husband, D. Juan Bexarano, beginning Madrid 2 March 1673.  Photocopy of valuation of paintings by Francisco Brisarte, painter.'","On the death of Antonia María de Arce Calderón (d. 22 February 1673), her husband, Don Juan Bexarano, drew up an inventory of their estate, beginning on 2 March 1673. The small collection of paintings was valued by Francisco Brisarte, painter, on 16 May 1673. None of the paintings was identified by author, and the values suggest that the collection was made up of some pictures of high aesthetic quality and others with a purely devotional function. The most highly valued painting, for instance, was a large Immaculate Conception (no. 17) worth 1,500 reales, while a Crucifixion was valued at only 55 reales (no. 12), and a small Ecce Homo on vellum 22 reales (no. 34). Two genre paintings (bodegones) (no. 3) and a painting of the goddess Diana (no. 5), the single mythological subject in the collection, were also comparatively highly valued pictures. Nine paintings with religious subjects painted within floral arrangements (nos. 15, 23, 28, 33) reflect a growth in popularity of this genre of painting at court during the second half of the century. While generalized imaginary landscapes (paises) were extremely popular throughout the period, topographical views like Arce Calderón's paintings of four royal palaces (sitios reales) were less common (no. 21). Another unusual subject from contemporary life in this collection was a painting of a bullfight (no. 6).","Collectors Files:  Arce Calderón, Antonia María de","input"

Real was a bibliophile, owning a large library of books and a small picture collection, which were appraised by the painter Juan Bautista de la Cotera on 15 October 1647. Not surprisingly for a prominent member of the Consejo de la Inquisición, Real's figurative pictures were mostly of religious subjects. He did, however, own an example of the popular classical subject of the Burning of Troy (no. 16) and, more interestingly, a painting of Seneca (no. 3). While this latter painting perhaps reflected an educated interest in classical stocism, paintings of philosophers were generally popular by this date through copies after the works of Jusepe de Ribera. Seneca was especially admired for being austere and beyond reproach, and therefore an exemplary type for officials and ministers.","Collectors Files:  Real, Martín","input"

(Angela Delaforce provided the photocopy of the document transcribed here.) The paintings were appraised by Angelo Nardi on 17 September 1658. Alburquerque was the third wife of Francisco Fernández de la Cueva, 7th Duque of Alburquerque. She was the daughter of Doña Vittoria Colonna, Duquesa de Medina de Rioseco, and of the 8th Almirante de Castilla. She and her husband are listed as beneficiaries of the 1634 death inventory of her mother (see Doc. 18). It is possible that the collection contained works that had previously belonged to her mother, but since almost all of the paintings in both inventories were left anonymous, it is difficult to make direct comparisons. The vast majority of the paintings in the present document depicted religious themes, and just one carried the name of its author, a painting of St. Jerome attributed to Eugenio Caxés valued at 660 reales. The most valuable items, however, although anonymous, were listed at the head of the inventory. The first item, a painting of Christ carrying the Cross, was valued at 2200 reales. Item no.9, described as including fourteen paintings of Narcissus, Europa, and various allegorical figures, was valued at 4200 reales. These were among the few secular subjects found in the collection.","Collectors Files: Alburquerque, Duques de","input"

Nicolás de Cardona, Maestro de la Camara de Su Mag.d, drawn up by his widow, Da. Leonor Maria Fontana and Licenciado D. Marcelino Favia y Guzmán, member of Consejo de Su Mag.d and Alcalde de la Audiencia de Sevilla, beginning Madrid 4 January 1643.  Photocopy of paintings mentioned at various parts of the inventory.'","The postmortem inventory of Don Nicolás de Cardona, Maestro de la Cámara Real, was drawn up by his widow, Leonor María Fontana, and the licenciado Don Marcelino Favia y Guzmán, and begun on 4 January 1643. The document is an important record of the picture collection of a high-ranking courtier of the reign of Philip IV, and  itemizes works in the rooms of Cardona's Madrid house. It is not surprising that a courtier who served in the king's private chamber, and who occupied the status of Cardona in the palace hierarchy, should display in his home a portrait series of the Spanish royal family from the Emperor Charles V to the reigning king Philip IV, and the Conde-Duque de Olivares (nos. 1-8). Other portraits of European royalty listed at different points in the inventory were to be found in other rooms in the house. Cardona's office (nos. 45-51) was decorated with portraits of Roman Emperors, the Four Continents, eight Provinces, a portrait, three still lifes, and a figure perhaps representing Justice; the latter image perhaps provided an ideal guide in the performance of Cardona's official duties. The dining room was decorated with mythological subjects, nudes, and the portraits of a gypsy girl and Venetian women, perhaps because these were pictures of good quality to be seen by guests. Perhaps too these were considered fitting decoration in the sense that the aesthetic and sensory pleasure provided was analogous to the pleasures of the table. Other pictures here were landscapes, still lifes, and paintings of the Seasons, nature subjects that directly related to the consumption of food. Cardona's own portrait hung in his bedroom (no. 64), along with portraits of the Cardinal-Infante, Charles V, and six personifications of the Liberal Arts. In the context of this room, it might not be too far fetched to interpret the painting of a lioness lately delivered of a cub (no. 68) as a pun on the name of his wife, Leonora. Cardona's collection comprised a significant number of religious paintings, including a representation of the militant Counter-Reformation subject of the Triumph of the Church (no. 32), perhaps related to Rubens' tapestries for the Madrid convent of the Encarnación, and a portrait of Raymund Llull (no. 34). However, Cardona's paintings show a wide variety of subject matter, which reflects a broader and, perhaps, more informed interest in paintings than some of his contemporaries. Although paintings of female nudes were risqué subjects in private collections of the day, Cardona owned two paintings of nude nymphs (nos. 35, 57) and a nude Turkish lady (no. 60), as well as a Flemish nymph (no. 26). There was an erotic mythology of Venus and Vulcan embracing (no. 53), which perhaps had comic overtones, and was perhaps complemented by the subject of the aformentioned painting representing a nude nymph and an old man (no. 35). Two other mythologies in landscape settings represented the story of Pyramus and Thisbe (no. 16) and Orpheus (no. 55). There was a representation of Springtime (no. 38) and a number of genre subjects on panel in black ebony frames which may have been Flemish pictures, including depictions of blind men (no. 36), figures playing (no. 37), and a landscape with a Fleming smoking (no. 42). A painting of a barber removing calluses from a patient was probably a comic work (no. 44).","Collectors Files:  Cardona, Nicolás de","input"

Partition of estate ff.108-435.'","Don Fernando de Meneses Bravo de Sarabia (d. 15 October 1731) was a Gentilhombre de la Cámara and, naturally, his collection included portraits of the king, probably Philip V, and his queen (nos. 57, 68). On his death in 1731, the inventory and valuation of his estate were drawn up by his widow María Ana Josefa de Montalvo y Cabrera, who had the royal painter Juan Delgado value the collection.  This collection is included here as an example of a conventional collection that was probably formed in the reign of Charles II and had remained unchanged by the advent of the new Bourbon monarchy. Although none of the paintings were attributed to an artist, a few were described as having been painted in Valencia (nos. 27, 37, 45). Two paintings were Mexican works on mother-of-pearl (no. 61) and the collection included three versions of the Mexican Virgin of Guadalupe (nos. 48, 61, 74, 79). Meneses Bravo de Sarabia's collection appears to have comprised works of variable quality, judging from the range of values given to them in the appraisal. The range of subjects was also varied. Some of the more highly valued works were among the mythological paintings, including paired paintings of gods and goddesses (nos. 66, 67) and a series of seven works depicting the story of Polyphemus (no. 80). The paintings which headed the valuation were a valuable set of large pictures of the Four Condemned, the subject of famous paintings by Titian and Jusepe Ribera in the Spanish royal collections.","Collectors Files:  Meneses Bravo de Sarabia, Fernando de","input"

The most distinguished painting in this appraisal was a Sacrifice of Abraham by Murillo (no. 2), a painter who was highly admired by this date but whose works may have been comparatively rare on the Madrid market. This undoubtedly contributed to its high valuation, which was put higher than those of paintings of an equivalent size attributed, perhaps optimistically, to artists such as Van Dyck (no. 1) and Ribera (no. 9).","Collectors Files:  Córdoba y Verdes, Manuel de","input"

Although only 29 pictures were listed in Carculli's estate at this time, the document is noteworthy for the fact that all but eight works in Miranda's valuation are attributed to specific artists. Some of Miranda's attributions appear to be optimistic, such as the picture of Belshazzar's Feast by Caravaggio himself (no. 2) and game still lifes by El Greco and Pietro da Cortona (nos. 10, 7). However, the collection did include a set of six flowerpieces by Juan de Arellano (no. 13) and works by two other seventeenth-century Madrid painters: a highly valued painting of St. Augustine by Vicencio Carducho (no. 9) and a picture of the Eucharist by Juan Carreño de Miranda (no. 11).","Collectors Files: Carculli, Gaspar, Doctor","input"

A pair of portraits of king Charles II and his queen in Olmo's collection (nos. 18 ) were attributed to Juan Carreño de Miranda and suggest that Olmo may have first entered royal service during his reign. However, he may also have inherited these paintings, as he did a picture of the Entombment of Christ by Alonso del Arco (no. 35) and a large and valuable painting of the Mystic Marriage of St. Catherine by Mateo Cerezo (no. 10).

His inventory was drawn up by his widow Josepha de Rivera. His paintings were valued on 30 January 1741 by the painter Manuel Gutierrez and included a set of portraits of the Bourbon royal family (no. 3). The attributions given in the appraisal were all to foreign artists of the previous two centuries. A painting of Mary Magdalene was considered an original by Correggio (no. 11) and sold privately. Another distinguished painting of Christ Appearing to the Magdalene (no. 12) was attributed to Van Dyck. The rest of the attributed paintings were all copies and school works, particularly the paintings of Rubens. School paintings were referred to by the term casta, meaning of the type of, but were nevertheless valuable paintings. Indeed, the work which headed Gutierrez's appraisal was the most valuable picture, a large Martyrdom of St. Hermengild casta de Rubenes.","Collectors Files:  Márquez, Juan Bautista","input"

She had been married first to Felix López de Ayala Velasco y Cárdenas, Conde de Fuensalida, and was the widow by second marriage to Melchor de Solís y Gantte Osorio y Sarmiento. The postmortem inventory and valuation of her goods took place in Madrid between 11 September and 23 October, 1752, with her paintings valued on 12 September 1752 by Pedro Rodríguez Miranda, painter.  This was evidently a fine and extensive picture collection, but only a small number of paintings were attributed. The most valuable of the paintings by a Spanish hand was the portrait of the Inquisitor General Diego Sarmiento de Valladares painted by Juan Carreño de Miranda (no. 74), a painting which is perhaps identifiable with the portrait of a seated cleric in Toledo, Hospital Tavera, Fundación Medinaceli. (See A.E. Pérez Sánchez, Carreño, Rizi, Herrera y la pintura madrileña de su tiempo, Madrid, Museo del Prado, 1986, no. 52). However, the most highly valued works by far were a St. Jerome by Albrecht Dürer (no. 49), worth a staggering 22.000 reales, and four large paintings by Luca Giordano (nos. 1, 3, 12), worth a total of 34.000 reales.","Collectors Files:  Atrisco, Duques de","input"

The extensive collection of paintings was valued for sale between 16 and 19 June 1747, by Joseph Romero, a painter. Among the attributed pictures were works by eight Spanish painters; Luis de Morales (no. 4) and El Greco (no. 2), Alonso Cano (no. 89), Claudio Coello (no. 43), and an unknown artist Ignacio Blasco (no. 20). A Murillo genre painting of a poor person delousing himself (no. 16) is reminiscent of a painting of this subject by the artist in the Louvre; however, it is unclear what is meant by a Pinttura de dibuxos by Zurbarán (no. 82). Jusepe Ribera, the Spanish painter of greatest international renown, was represented by five paintings in the collection (nos. 5, 46, 48, 86, 87), including two copies after his compositions (nos. 49, 76). Paintings attributed to Spanish hands were outnumbered by those given to foreign artists, a number of which were copies. The more valuable of these included a Pietà by Titian (no. 3), a mythological subject by Guercino (no. 31), works by Giordano (nos. 29, 60) and highly valued paintings by Rubens (nos. 1, 10, also no. 99 with Jan Fyt). Copies after Rubens (no. 81), Pietro da Cortona (no. 45), and Poussin (no. 75), were also given relatively high valuations.","Collectors Files:  Ugena, Isabel María de la Cruz Ahedo, Marquesa de","input"

Documents for the History of Collecting: Spanish Inventories 1, Collections of Paintings in Madrid 1601-1755 (Los Angeles: Getty, 1997), pp.618-622.","","","Burke writes:  'Inventory and tasación of the estate of Don Ramiro Felípez Núñez de Guzmán, Duque de Sanlúcar la Mayor and Duque de Medina de las Torres, who died 8 December 1668; taken by his widow, Doña Catalina de Guevara, Condesa de Oñate y de Villamediana [i.e., in her own right].  The duke's paintings were inventoried on 8 January on 8 January 1669 (fols. 21-25) and appraised in 66 lots (numbered 232-297) by Juan Carreño de Miranda and Juan Cabezalero (fols. 39-44v), on 26 and 27 November 1669.' There is a woodcut or engraving of him in Stanzione monograph p. 319.  He was Viceroy of Naples 1637-1644.","Ramiro de Guzmán, Duque de Medina de las Torres (c. 1600-1668), was an important statesman of the Spanish Golden Age. (This entry is extracted from Burke, Paintings by Ribera in the Collection of the Duque de Medina de las Torres, The Burlington Magazine, vol. 131a, no. 1031, February 1989, pp. 132-36. For an overview of Medina de las Torres' political and diplomatic career, see R.A. Stradling, A Spanish Statesman of Appeasement: Medina de las Torres and Spanish Policy, 1639-1670, in The Historical Journal, vol. 19, 1976, pp. 1-31, citing extensive bibliography; G. Marañón, El Conde-Duque de Olivares (La pasión de mandar), 5th ed., Madrid 1965, pp. 154-57, 277-84, 298 note 30, and passim; and J. H. Elliott, The Count-Duke of Olivares: The Statesman in an Age of Decline, pp. 166-68, 260-64, 278, 376, 396, 420, 429, 477-78, 561, 592-93, 632, 648-49, 669-72, and plate 30.) He married Olivares' daughter in 1624, and although the marriage ended with her premature death in 1626, he retained his father-in-law's favor. Originally the Marqués de Toral, he was created Duque de Medina de las Torres at Olivares' request. Medina de las Torres had begun collecting pictures before leaving Spain for Naples in 1638, and he eventually was to give works by Raphael, Correggio, and the Bassani to King Philip IV. His ownership of a collection, including a group of works by Juan de Jaureguí, was mentioned by Carducho in 1633 (Diálogos de la pintura, Madrid 1633, f. 156 -- reprinted in F.J. Sánchez Cantón, Fuentes literarias para la historia del arte español, vol. 2 Madrid 1933, p. 110f.). As already mentioned in the text, it is commonly assumed that it was Medina de las Torres, as Viceroy of Naples (from 1638 to 1643) who commissioned Ribera's Martyrdom of St. Philip for Philip IV in 1639 (Prado 1101). Although Medina de las Torres' death inventory is disappointing both in its small size -- only 66 lots -- and in the paucity of attributions suggested by the evaluators, it does document Medina de las Torres' ownership of two works by Ribera: a Dream of Jacob and a Liberation of St. Peter, here identified somewhat controversially as the works in the Prado, nos. 1117 and 1073. These pictures, both signed and dated 1639, are nearly identical in size: the Jacob measures 179 x 233 cm., the Liberation 177 x 232 cm. Their complementary compositions suggest they were conceived as a pair. Furthermore, they entered the Spanish royal collections together, via Isabel Farnese's gallery at La Granja (Prado 1985, pp. 548 and 557). In the inventory, they are listed as a large St. Peter when the angel released him from prison, and another picture, of the same size, of Jacob, both originals by Jusephe [sic] de Rivera appraised at 3,000 reales each (lots 236 and 237). The identification of the Jacob with the work in the Prado rests on the identical sizes of the Prado's Dream of Jacob and Liberation of St. Peter. The brevity of the description and lack of dimensions for the image of Jacob in the inventory leaves open the possibility, recently raised by Alfonso E. Pérez-Sánchez (Pérez-Sánchez and Spinosa 1992, pp. 102 and 139), that the two Medina de las Torres works were not the pictures in the Prado but rather two similarly-sized works at the Escorial: a Jacob with the Flocks of Laban (signed and dated 1632) and another Liberation of St. Peter. Although Pérez-Sánchez rightly notes that there is no reason why Medina might not have collected two earlier works rather than commissioned two new ones, this assumes that Ribera, who seems generally to have been working on commissions in the 1630s, had two pictures of roughly the same size on two unusual Biblical subjects in stock and ready to sell to Medina. It is not clear, moreover, that the two Escorial works were conceived as a pair: the Dream of Joseph and the Liberation of St. Peter at the Prado both show angelic intervention in human affairs, but how might one relate the story of Laban laying peeled rods to Peter's release? There is also the problem of fitting the two into the history of the decoration of the Escorial. Medina died in 1668, after the campaigns to decorate the chapter rooms were completed. It may be that the two Riberas were bought for the crown sometime thereafter and figured among the 20 works sent by Charles II in 1675. It seems more likely, however, that that the Escorial works came to the monastery earlier, possibly separately, so that the pair dating to Medina's viceroyalty would have been commissioned by him. Also attributed to Ribera in the inventory are a large Nativity (no. 1; 6,600 reales) and a Venus (no. 2; 5,000 reales), neither of which may be identified with certainty among Ribera's extant paintings (The citation of a Venus adds yet another conflicting item to the documentation relating to the Venus and Adonis in the Corsini Gallery, Rome. See C. Felton and W.B. Jordan, Jusepe de Ribera, Fort Worth, 1982, pp. 178-181). Other pictures of interest in the collection were a Prophet and a Sibyl (no. 7; 1,000 reales each), a rounded Holy Family (no. 9; 1,500 reales), a Madonna and Child with the Young St. John and St. Bernard (also said to be rounded -- no. 10; 1,100 reales), a medium-sized Adoration of the Magi (no. 12; 1,100 reales), and a large Deposition (no. 58; 2,200 reales). None of these is attributed in the inventory, but several suggest known works by Ribera. For example, the composition with St. Bernard, except for its rounded shape (due to framing?), reminds one of Ribera's Madonna and Child with the Young St. John and St. Bruno now in Weimar (Kunstsammlungen; 205 x 153.5 cm., signed and dated 1634). To judge from published photographs, the Weimar canvas may be cut down at the top, and it would have been easy to confuse the two Carthusian saints. Also of interest is the group of secular pieces, some with unusual descriptions. No. 3, for example, lists a medium-sized fable of a naked woman and a man who comes talking to her on horseback. There was also a pair of pictures of fables, the one of a naked woman with some children and the other of another [woman] riding a male goat (no. 8; 600 reales). A large composition of a naked woman with her ladies, looking at herself in a mirror (no. 4; 3,000 reales) recalls compositions of Venus and the Graces or Venus at her Toilette by Liss, Reni, Albani, and other Seicento painters. These secular and, in fact, pagan and erotic subjects point once again to the common phenomenon of sensual aspects or erotic subjects in noble collections. As in the case of many other collectors, it is likely that most of the secular works were acquired during Medina de las Torres' tenure in Naples. Finally, two northern European works should be noted: a version of Bosch's Triumph of Death (no. 11; 1,650 reales) and a very large panel of Venus and Mars by Maarten de Vos (no. 46; approximately 6 by 12 feet, 4,000 reales). (It has proved impossible to identify this panel. De Vos was principally a religious painter, but there are several extant mythological pictures by his hand which suggest what the Medina de las Torres Venus and Mars might have looked like. See, for example, the Venus Mourning Adonis that he painted ca. 1575 -- illustrated in A. Zweite, Marten de Vos als Maler, Berlin 1980, cat. 44, pp. 281-82 and 341, fig. 54. For a general discussion of the role of secular myth in De Vos' oeuvre, see Zweite, pp. 166-73 and 220-23. For information on De Vos' influence in Spain and Mexico, see F. de la Maza, El pintor Martín de Vos en México (Mexico City 1971), passim.) Other northern works may also have been included; for example, given the prevalence of Flemish landscapes in Madrid collections, it is highly likely that some of the many landscapes in Medina de la Torres' gallery came to Madrid from the north. For the most part, the values given to the pictures conform to those encountered in other Madrid inventories of the second half of the seventeenth century. Two interesting items should, however, be noted. First, the highest-priced picture in the collection was not an original composition but a copy after Raphael's Transfiguration (no. 50 -- called Mount Tabor; appraised at 11,000 reales), a huge piece constructed out of two panels, each nine feet high. This picture may almost certainly be identified with the fine copy now in the Prado (no. 315). Second, there was a Flower Piece, one of the few still lifes in the collection (no. 13), appraised at 1,100 reales, or 100 ducats. This relatively high price underscores once again the continuous upward valuation of the genres during the seventeenth century. Like many of the noble collectors, Medina de las Torres appears not to have been very interested in the local Spanish school -- except for Ribera and the appraisers themselves, no Spanish artists are mentioned in the document. Since we know that he owned works by the gentleman-painter Juan de Jaureguí, cited by Carducho in 1633, it may be that the portraits of Philip IV, Olivares, and other notables of the previous régime (nos. 59-63), as well as other unattributed works, were in fact Spanish. The inventory was taken by his widow, Doña Catalina de Guevara, Condesa de Oñate y de Villamediana (i.e., in her own right). The duque's paintings were inventoried on 8 January 1669 (ff. 21-25) and appraised in 66 lots (numbered 232-297, ff. 39-44v) on 26-27 November 1669 by Juan Carreño de Miranda (1614-1685), painter to His Majesty, and Carreño's younger colleague and former pupil, Juan Martín Cabezalero (1633-1673).","","input"

His postmortem inventory was drawn up by his widow Isabel Maldonado, beginning 10 April 1632, with his paintings inventoried between 13 and 14 April (ff. 32v-37v). The picture collection was appraised on 21 May 1632 by the royal painter Vicencio Carducho (ff. 157-164v). Carducho assigned high values to the paintings, which necessitated the reappraisal by the same artist on 7 June 1632 of a number at more realistic values reduced for their sale (ff. 165-170). While the inventory of this collection contained no attributions to artists, Carducho's valuation identified the hands of seven artists, six of whom were Italian, while the last was a drawing of the Adoration of the Kings by Rubens (no. 87). Carducho was himself an Italian painter of Florentine extraction and had perhaps for that reason been called upon to appraise a collection that contained significant examples of Italian painting. A pair of paintings on copper were recognized as copies after Guido Reni (nos. 13-14). These were as valuable as a large St. Lawrence that Carducho evidently believed to be by Titian himself (no. 84). Two paintings of low valuation attributed to Bassano (nos. 52 and 70) are unlikely to have been originals. Carducho used his expertise to identify the authors of three other valuable paintings, all worth around 400 reales: a Visitation by Federico Barocci (no. 36), a Coronation of the Virgin by the short-lived Taddeo Zuccari (no. 37), and a Christ at the Column by the Cavalier d'Arpino (no. 26). The fact that these were all religious paintings reflects the overwhelmingly religious nature of Cortés' collection. It did, however, contain a number of portraits, including that of Cortés himself (no. 71). There were also some landscapes and still lifes in addition to a genre painting (no. 67), but the only mythological subjects identified were a picture of Cupid (no. 101) amid a small landscape with Pan and Syrinx (no. 91).","Collectors Files:  Cortés, Alonso, Doctor","input"

Photocopies (iv) and (v) are both part of the sale beginning 17 August 1662.'","The postmortem inventory of Doctor Don Pedro Pacheco (d. 23 July 1662), a Councilor of Castille since 1634 and member of the Consejo General de Inquisición, began on 23 July 1662, and was drawn up by colleagues in the royal administration whom he had nominated as his executors, the councilor Juan de Astorga, and the royal secretaries Francisco de Oviedo, himself the owner of an important picture collection (Doc. 73), and Don Bartolomé Moreno. In Pacheco's will, opened on the day he died, he bequeathed a small devotional painting of the Magdalene to Astorga, a precious Crucifix to Oviedo, and to Moreno a painting of the Virgin (AHPM, Prot. 9.803, ff. 1-10). Other persons were also willed religious pictures from his collection. The paintings from his oratory, and also his library of books, were willed to the convent of San Francisco in the town of Montalbán. The library of the convent received a marble Christ and 12 framed paintings of hermit saints, all the same size, by Ribera.  Pacheco's paintings were inventoried on 28 July (ff. 555-558v), and their appraisal by the painter Luis Fernández took place on 7 August (ff. 569v-588v). The sale by public auction of Pacheco's goods opened in Madrid on 17 August; some paintings were sold to distinguished bidders, including the Conde de Montalbán, Marquesa de Almanacin, and Don Juan González, the latter buying 47 pictures, including El Greco's View of Toledo (no. 12) for a total of 5,710 reales. The majority of artists listed in the valuation of Pacheco's collection were Spanish. It would appear then that this collector sought works by Spanish artists and court contemporaries rather than old master and foreign paintings, as a matter of choice, availability, or economic necessity. The oldest Spanish painting was a portrait of one of Pacheco's ancestors by Alonso Sánchez Coello (no. 48). Unfortunately, the identity of the sitter of a Velázquez portrait is not given (no. 19), nor are the identities of a series of six portraits of writers (no. 86). One remarkable aspect of this collection was the large number of landscape paintings it contained. Of the 207 pictures listed in Fernández's valuation, some 138 were landscapes, 98 of which made up sets of more than two works. These paintings included cityscapes, landscapes on canvas and metal supports, perspectives, battles, a seastorm (no. 15), landscapes with religious subjects, and a Burning of Troy. There were landscapes from Italy as well as the more common type of city views from Flanders (nos. 1) and nine landscapes by an artist entered as Boy in the valuation, which may represent a garbled form of the name Pedro de Vos (nos. 6, 7). More interesting still were the landscape paintings in the valuation attributed to Spanish hands; the document lists works by the Mallorcan (no. 5), Francisco de Collantes (nos. 8, 9), Pedro Núñez del Valle (nos. 14, 28), Eugenio Caxés (no. 17), and Pedro de Orrente (no. 23). One painting appears to have been a version of El Greco's famous View of Toledo (Washington, National Gallery) (no. 12). Pacheco also owned a portrait (no. 55) and a St. Dominic (no. 75) by El Greco. In keeping perhaps with Pacheco's interest in the minor genres of painting, his collection also included small genre pictures, which may have been Flemish (nos. 38, 41), still lifes (nos. 31, 37, 42, 52-54, 64,74, 78), personifications of the Seasons (no. 67), as well as one Vanitas painting (no. 32).","Collectors Files:  Pacheco, Pedro, Doctor","input"

","The inventory of Don Gregorio Ortiz de Santecilla, Knight of Santiago and member of the king's council at his estate at Tarriva del Consejo de Nava, was drawn up by Don Joachín de Leoz and begun in Madrid on 3 January 1676. The paintings were appraised by Andres de Smidt. The collection consisted of approximately 70 to 80 paintings, all but five of which lacked the name of the author. Two battle scenes by Juan Bautista de Toledo and a copy after Falcone were valued at 330 and 440 reales, respectively (nos. 4, 5), and were apparently the most distinguished examples of this genre in the collection. A painting of Robbers given to an unidentified Brueghel (probably Jan Brueghel the Elder) was valued at 550 reales (no. 27). Two copies after Bassano and van Dyck are also listed (nos. 6, 8). But the most valuable works were anonymous and are found at the head of the inventory. The first item, a Rape of Proserpine, was valued at 11.000 reales, a very large sum, and an indication that this one painting was considered the star, since nothing else approached it. A depiction of St. Jerome was placed at 2200 reales (no. 58). The bulk of the collection was well below this figure. As was usual, most of the paintings were of religious subjects, both biblical and devotional, but there was a wide variety of other things, including landscapes, still lifes and marine pictures.","Collectors files:  Ortiz de Santecilla, Gregorio","input"

Partition of estate ff.924-967, Madrid 28 August 1724.'","Don Andrés de Medrano y Mendizábal (Seville 1654-1720 Madrid) became a Knight of Calatrava in 1690. He enjoyed a distinguished career in the administration of King Charles II; he was nominated Secretario de Estado y del Despacho in 1691 and appointed a member of King Charles II's Council of Castile on 30 March 1697. He inherited the title of Conde de Torrubia in 1695 from his brother, Don García de Medrano. Medrano had married Francisca de Angulo y Arbizu, daughter of Don Juan de Angulo, knight of Santiago, in 1693 and the contents of his picture collection are known from the document of estate, between his widow and other heirs, dated in Madrid on 12 August 1724 (See Fayard, 1982, pp.164, 238, 271, 281, 283, 425, 427, 429). Medrano owned a portrait of King Charles II, and of the regent, Mariana of Austria (d.1696). His collection was made up almost entirely of religious paintings, including a picture by Mateo Cerezo of the miraculous statue of Christ from Burgos (no. 16). There was a set of images of Sibyls, battle scenes and landscapes. The list of paintings in the partition document of Medrano's estate is headed by a picture of the Nativity of Christ (no. 1) by Luca Giordano, which carried the highest value in the collection, matched only by an unfinished work by El Greco (no. 19). While Medrano could have acquired his picture of St. Michael (no. 61) by Antonio de Pereda before the artist's death in 1678, and his picture by Giordano from the artist himself, he may have inherited some of the older works by El Greco (nos. 39, 40) and copies after Titian (nos. 22, 42) and Ribera (no. 32).","Collectors Files:  Torrubia, Andrés de Medrano y Mendizaval, Conde de","input"

Photocopy (iv) for paintings sold ff. 777-780, 23 September 1618.' [Values are given in Roman numerals.]","At the time of his death, Gaspar de Ledesma Meriño (d. 21 January 1618) was entitled a jurado of Baeza, which meant that he was a member of the governing municipal council (consejo) of that town. Eight days after Ledesma Meriño's death, his widow, Lucia Gentil, drew up an inventory of their goods in Madrid, which included his extensive library, and had the estate valued. Two painters were nominated to appraise the picture collection, the licenciado Juan de Roelas and Angelo Nardi. This was undertaken in three sessions on 27 April, 7 May, and 3 June 1618, with the values assigned in Roman numerals. The appraisal of 27 April comprised paintings which Ledesma Meriño owned at court, while the pictures appraised in the following sessions of 7 May and 3 June had been brought from Baeza, where he had the bulk of his collection. One of the reasons that Nardi could have been chosen to value the collection was that Ledesma had patronized the artist. In the accounts of the estate of the deceased, his widow paid Nardi a balance of 100 reales on some paintings which he had made (Ledesma) in his lifetime (AHPM, Prot. 5.073, ff. 822-822v). Nardi and Roelas also bought gold and silver items at Ledesma's estate auction, where Nardi also acquired some clothing. Ledesma Meriño's collection included his own portrait (no. 25) and apparently, his coat of arms (nos. 24 and 60). Among the few attributed paintings in the appraisal, there were two pictures of Noah's Ark by the Bassani (nos. 22), as well as an image of Christ copied after an unspecified Bassano (no. 32). One of the most important paintings in the collection was a small and valuable Resurrected Christ by Gaspar Becerra (1520-ca. 1568-70) (no. 29), who worked in Rome ca. 1545-1557 and brought the innovations of Michelangelo to Spain. Only two contemporary Spanish artists were cited by name: Juan de la Corte, by whom there was a battle picture (no. 47), and Pedro de Orrente, who had painted one of the landscapes (no. 46). Two other landscapes in the collection were by the famous Netherlandish specialist active in Rome, Paul Bril (nos. 45 and 51), one of which was a copy. Ledesma Meriño's collection of paintings included mythological subjects, which perhaps reflected an earlier humanist taste of the sixteenth century. An unidentified fable was said to be by Parmigianino (no. 35), and there was a painting of the Ledas (no. 23), as well as another bust-length painting of Leda (no. 53). Two paintings on canvas which are called friezes of foliage (no. 59) may have been examples of decorative pictures with fruit, flowers, and birds deriving from the tradition of grotesque painting revived in the sixteenth century. Most remarkable of all, the appraisal listed one of Ledesma Meriño's own paintings of a head of Christ (no. 66). This is proof that this cultivated individual was not only a collector of paintings but himself an amateur artist. His interest in the practice of painting may also help to explain the collection of drawings and prints he owned, although these too would have appealed to a bibliophile with an interest in the visual arts such as Ledesma. Most of the unattributed drawings have not been included in the transcription here, but see for example, a drawing after Raphael (no. 80).  Remarkably, the authors of some of the drawings in the collection were named. The most highly prized works appear to have been three drawings by Gaspar Becerra, who was also a native of Ledesma Meriño's home town of Baeza and the author of his Resurrected Christ, cited above. Fragments of Becerra's drawings for frescoes in Philip II's royal chamber in the Madrid Alcázar and El Pardo, which have survived in the collections of the library of the monastery of the Escorial, remain as a precious testimony to the appreciation among connoisseurs of his abilities as a draughtsman (D. Angulo Iñiguez and A.E. Pérez Sánchez, A Corpus of Spanish Drawings, vol. 1, Spanish Drawings, 1400-1600, London, 1975, pp. 22-23, nos. 32-46). Carducho spoke of a friend showing him some drawings by Becerra, an experience which was for him doubly enjoyable, and in which his admiration for aquellos perfiles tan airosos, tan fundados en arte y ciencia, y tan cunplidos en todo was equaled only by his sadness that artists of his own day did not imitate them. (Carducho, ed. 1979, p. 179.) Two of Ledesma Meriño's drawings by Becerra represented the god Mercury (nos. 70 and 71) and one of Diana (no. 72). The Mercury drawings may have been preparatory studies for Becerra's Perseus frescoes in the Queen's Tower of the El Pardo palace which were painted in 1563, and one of them may even have been the modello of Mercury that the artist showed to Philip II, as recounted in Palomino. (Palomino, ed. 1986, p. 39.)  The depth of admiration for Becerra among connoisseurs is reflected in accounts of his life in Carducho (Carducho, ed.1979, pp. 128, 131-132, 179, 332, 431, 432), Díaz del Valle (Díaz del Valle, ed. Palomino, ed. 1986, p. 39.1933, pp. 342-343), and Palomino. The values of Ledesma Meriño's Becerra drawings were appreciably higher than two drawings of St. Lawrence (no. 78) and the Massacre of the Innocents (no. 79) by an artist called Bacho, referring to the Florentine Baccio Bandinelli (N.B. Díaz del Valle, ed. 1933, p. 342, in the life of Becerra speaks of Bacho Bandinelo). A portrait drawing of the Duque del Infantado (no. 84) was said to have been drawn by Philip II's royal painter Rómulo Cincinnato (ca.1540-97), who painted an extensive series of frescoes in the Infantado palace at Guadalajara in 1591 and who also worked at the Escorial. Worth least of all was the drawing of two Apostles by Juan Fernández de Navarrete (no. 74), which was most probably a preparatory study for his altarpieces in the basilica of the Escorial, and may have been colored, since it was described as a piece of paper with the painting (pintura) of two apostles. A drawing of Fortitude (which is not included in the following transcription) was anonymous in the valuation, but could be connected with Francisco de Urbino's preparatory drawings for allegories that he painted in the prior's lower cell of the Escorial in 1581. A drawing of this subject by Urbino exists in the Escorial library. (Angulo and Pérez Sánchez 1975, p. 62, no. 277.)  Four drawings (traças) of the Escorial (not transcribed here) further suggest that Ledesma Meriño had access to the studios of artists who worked at the building. Perhaps his drawing of an altarpiece with its custodia (no. 77) was a study for the high altar of the basilica. Ledesma Meriño's entire collection of paintings was sold at the public auction of his goods, which opened on 2 May 1618. Among the collectors buying pictures was Don Jerónimo Zapata de Villafuerte, whom Carducho (Carducho ed.1979, pp. 422, 423) listed among the most important collectors at court, and the silversmith Andrés de Villarroel, whose collection is included below (Doc. 62). Villafuerte bought two of the most important pictures from the collection, the small panel of the Risen Christ by Gaspar Becerra (no. 29) on 8 May and a mythological subject attributed to Parmigianino (no. 35) at the following day's sale. On 28 September he bought the first of the drawings of Mercury by Becerra listed in the appraisal (no. 70). Villarroel bought paintings of Jacob's Dream (no. 39),  Emmaus (no. 19 or 40), David (no. 44), and a landscape with a hermit (no. 38), the last painting probably the landscape copied after Paul Bril which was inventoried in Villarroel's collection in 1656 (Doc. 62, no. 4).","Collectors Files:  Ledesma Meriño, Gaspar de","input"

The postmortem inventory and valuation of his estate was opened on 30 April 1750, when, in order to avoid costs, it was decided to follow the earlier inventory/valuation of his deceased wife Ana María de Soroa (d. 11 June 1743) drawn up nearly seven years earlier. Thus, the valuation of paintings from Zuaznabar's estate, dated 6 July 1750, follows exactly the original valuation of the paintings by the royal painter Andrés de la Calleja of 25 June 1743. On 7 July 1750, Zuaznabar's widow, Francisca Antonia de Zuaznabar, ordered a new inventory and valuation of remaining goods from her husband's estate, which included some paintings valued by Andrés de la Calleja but not included in the original document. Andrés de la Calleja was Pintor de Cámara to Philip and responsible for restoring paintings from the royal collection damaged by the Alcázar fire of 1734. Zuaznabar's collection included two of his portraits of unidentified Infantes (no. 6), as well as a pair of religious subjects by another royal painter of the Bourbon dynasty, Miguel Jacinto Menéndez (no. 27). One of the most interesting aspects of the collection, however, was the presence of paintings by major artists of the Madrid school of the previous century, including Antonio de Pereda (no. 22), Carreño de Miranda (no. 29), Sebastian de Herrera Barnuevo (nos. 8, 9), and a valuable picture by Juan Martín Cabezalero (no. 5). A painting of the Holy Family by Claudio Coello was paired with a representation of Charity by Luca Giordano (no. 7). The high value of a painting by Murillo of San Francisco de Paula (no. 3) is testimony to the esteem in which works by this Andalusian master were held by collectors in the eighteenth century. The highest value, however, was reserved for a large painting of the Rest on the Flight into Egypt by Jusepe Ribera (no. 1), which was placed at the head of the inventory.","Collectors Files:  Zuaznabar, Miguel Antonio de","input"

Many of the paintings in Spino y Navarro's estate came from the partition of Spino y Navarro's first wife Catalina del Mazo Velázquez, a decendant (daughter?) of Juan Bautista del Mazo (ca. 1610/1612 - 2/10/1667). Mazo's children with Velazquez were Gaspar, who became the usher to the bedchamber of the King in 1658, Melchior, Baltasar, who also worked in the palace, and Maria Teresa.  His children with Francisca (or Ana?) de la Vega were José Antonio, Luis, Francisco, and Fernando Felipe. He apparently had other wives after these two.  But the fact that her full name is given in the intro as Mazo Velazquez - she must be a child of Mazo's marriage with Velazquez's daughter.","The following inventory of paintings owned by Joseph Spino y Navarro comes from the partition of his estate between his wife Da. Gerónima de Miranda y Testa and his children, dated Madrid 19 August 1744. Spino y Navarro was Grefier of the king, a complementary office of the controller of the expense accounts of the royal household. Many of the paintings in Spino y Navarro's estate came from the partition of his first wife Catalina del Mazo. She was the daughter of Baltasar del Mazo and Melchora de Savedra, the former being one of the sons of the painter and son-in-law of Velázquez, Juan Bautista del Mazo (1610/1612-1667) (See the testament of Catalina del Mazo y Velázquez of 13 April, 1707 at AHPM, Prot. 12.201, fols.478-479). Unfortunately, few of the paintings in the collection were attributed. Six works by Alonso del Arco (no. 89), Simón de León Leal (nos. 96 ), Luca Giordano (no. 31) and Gabriel de la Corte (nos. 25, 84) all formed part of the inheritance of the widow, Jerónima de Miranda. The most valuable and distinguished painting in the collection was the Portrait of the Family of Juan Bautista del Mazo now in Vienna (Fig. 101), which came from the estate of Catalina del Mazo.","Collectors Files:  Spino y Navarro, José","input"

Photocopy of paintings inventoried, 23 August-28 August 1652, ff. 1422-1425v.'","The postmortem inventory of Bernardo Fernández de Velasco y Tovar, Condestable de Castilla y de Léon, drawn up by his executors, the Duquesa de Frias, Marquesa de Verlanga and Luís Fernández de Tovar y Velasco, Marqués de Fresno, began in Madrid on 31 March 1652. The large picture collection was inventoried between 23-28 August 1652 (ff. 1422-1425v), but no valuation of this was recorded. Despite the obvious importance of the collection, none of the paintings listed was attributed to an artist. Some of the subjects were typical of collections formed at the turn of the century, such as the series of Seven Infantes of Lara (no. 36) and portraits of popes, cardinals, and famous men (no. 59). The large numbers of family portraits in the collection undoubtedly formed a part of the inheritance of the Condestable, including the series of 46 portraits of his ancestors (no. 21). There were three portraits of Bernardo himself, one of which was only sketched in (nos. 24, 27, 28). A painting of Don Juan de Velasco, Condestable de Castilla and Duque de Frías (d.1613), who was portrayed with the Spanish delegation at the signing of the peace treaty with England in 1604 (no. 29), is The Somerset House Conference painted by Pantoja de la Cruz? in 1604 (London, National Portrait Gallery, London, National Gallery, El Greco to Goya: The Taste for Spanish Paintings in Britain and Ireland, by A. Braham, London, 1981, pp. 5-6). The collection contained mythological subjects, including three of Venus (nos. 41, 54, and 61), one of Diana (no. 51), and one of Ganymede (no. 50). A pair of paintings of female figures were personifications of the Liberal Arts of Music and Grammar (no. 57). Two paintings of Venetian women (no. 57) were probably representations of ideal beauties, but a picture of a lady with a devil at her side (no. 38), flanked by two fruit still lifes, perhaps signified a more misogynistic view. A number of hunting paintings (no. 45), pictures of fishing and fowling (nos. 55), and fishing subjects (no. 44) appropriately evoked noble country pursuits. Landscapes (no. 46) and pictures of the Seasons and Months (nos. 48 and 49) were also consistent with this theme and aristocratic taste.","Collectors Files:  Castilla, Bernardo Fernández de Velasco y Tovar, Condestable de","input"

Photocopy of valuation of paintings, Madrid 7 April 1751, by Andrés de la Calleja, painter.' [In Enciclopedia Heraldica y Genealogica Hispano-Americana vol. 59 p.113, it gives his name as Juan Moreno y Villodas and her name as Ana Mar'ia Negrete y Ampuero also lists their son's name.]","The inventory/valuation of Julian Moreno de Villodas (d. 5 April 1751), Secretario Mayor y Más Antiguo del Ayuntamiento de Madrid, was drawn up by his widow María Manuela Gutierrez Carriazo and his son Antonio Moreno y Negrette, Knight of Santiago and Regidor Perpetuo de Madrid, beginning 6 April 1751. (Barrio Moya 1989 published the extensive library of Moreno de Villodas and mentioned the artist attributions in his picture collection.) His paintings were valued on 7 April 1751, by the royal painter Andrés de la Calleja. While it is to be imagined that Calleja was able to distinguish the hands of different artists, some of the attributions in the inventory seem overly optimistic. A number of genre paintings were given to Velázquez (nos. 23, 24, 35, 38) and a miniature by Michelangelo (no. 10), depicting the Rape of Ganymede was probably a painting based on a copy of a drawing, such as the one Pacheco mentioned in the collection of Don Francisco de Tejada (Pacheco, ed.1990, pp.455-456). However, there is no reason to question the attributions to Spanish artists.  One of the most interesting works was a framed drawing of a crucified Christ by Alonso Cano (no. 72), an artist renowned for his skill as a draughtsman. Moreno de Villodas also owned a set of six flowerpieces on the theme of the Life of the Virgin, which were probably garlands surrounding figurative scenes (no. 83). The flowers were painted by the flower specialist Gabriel de la Corte, and the figures by Antolinez, most probably referring to Corte's contemporary, Don Francisco Ochoa y Antolínez. It is worth noting that these works were less highly valued than a pair of flowerpieces on copper by the Flemish artist Jan Philip van Thielen (no. 12). Francisco Antolínez was surely also the author of four landscapes in the collection (no. 34), and Palomino noted his expertise in this field. These landscapes were listed directly after another group of four landscapes by Andrés Smidt (no. 33), a German artist at the court of Charles II, which is further evidence of the widespread activity of landscape painting among Madrid painters. Other Spanish painters mentioned in the document were Luis de Morales (nos. 5, 15), El Greco (no. 6) and Juan de Roelas (no. 9), as well as painters of the next century, Carreño de Miranda (no. 37) and Escalante (no. 42). The works of Murillo were highly sought after by this date, and Moreno de Villodas owned a copy of a painting of the Virgin and Child with St. Anne copied by Jerónimo Antonio Ezquerra (no. 46).  Some of the foreign artists named in the document are difficult to identify today (nos. 28, 29, 39). It is not surprising, however, that works attributed to Venetian old masters were among the most valuable in the collection; thus a damaged painting of the Last Supper from the school of Titian was valued at 2,800 reales (no. 3). Two paintings by the Bassano family were also highly valued (nos. 4, 36), especially the Forge of Vulcan by Leandro Bassano, worth 5,000 reales (no. 4). One of the most intriguing paintings in the collection, from a documentary point of view, was a self-portrait of Tintoretto (no. 8).","Collectors Files:  Moreno de Villodas, Julián","input"

He was Vizconde de Encinar and was made Marqués del Puerto in 1741, when Philip V send him as extraordinary ambasssador to Sweden. Fernando VI made him ambassador to Holland and he died at The Hague on 10 March 1753. His postmortem estate inventory was drawn up by Juan Bautista de Ayerta on the authority of the son, Fernando Barrenechea, Marqués de Salana, and begun in Madrid on 26 March 1753. The paintings were valued by the royal painter Andrés de la Calleja on 26 March 1753 and were sold in the estate sale which began a year later, on 26 March 1754.  This collection was noteworthy for the presence of paintings from the Neapolitan school. Some of the paintings were listed anonymously (nos. 27, 28, 37), but there was a group of nine still life paintings by the Recco family (nos. 9, 13, 23, 24), five pictures by Giacomo Farelli (nos. 8, 10), and a Mary Magdalene from the school of Massimo Stanzione (no. 4). Some of the other unidentified authors in this collection were evidently Italian painters, perhaps also working in Naples (nos. 25, 32, 35). Unusually, only one painting was attributed to a Spanish artist, a landscape by the Mallorcan specialist Pedro Cotto (no. 40). This was associated with a pair of landscapes by Andrés Smidt, the German artist active at the court of Charles II (no. 49), by whom works were also listed in the contemporary collection of Julián Moreno de Villodas (Doc. 137). A painting by Luca Giordano (no. 30), was also present and presumably had been painted by the artist while living in Spain.","Collectors Files:  Puerto, Joaquín Ignacio de Barnachea, Vizconde de Enzinar y Marqués del","input"

It was drawn up by her husband, Alonso Fernández de Córdoba, Marqués de Celada and Majordomo de Su Majestad. The paintings of the collection were appraised by Domingo Gómez, while the paintings in the oratory were separately appraised by Juan Sánchez. There was a sale of her goods beginning 15 April 1617. This collection included just 45 items of value, none of which are attributed to a specific artist. The paintings consisted primarily of religious subjects, but there were also a few portraits, flower pieces, and even a view of Venice. Five pieces of sculpture were also included as well as a group of eight small images of illumination (luminacion). Some of the paintings carried surprisingly high valuations. A painting of the Nativity was given the highest figure, being appraised at 2.000 reales. An Assumption of the Magdalene was listed at 550 reales, and five others, including the View of Venice, were given amounts in excess of 300 reales. A portrait of the deceased Marquesa was valued at 500 reales. The author of this portrait was probably known to her husband but his name is not given.

The latter inherited the pictures, ff. 620-636.'","The postmortem inventory of Don Joseph Salvador Sarmiento, Conde de Salvatierra, Marqués de Sobroso, was begun in Madrid, on 3 May 1681, by his executors and widow, María Antonia Sarmiento y Velasco. The paintings collection was inventoried on 4 December and valued by the painter Antonio Palomino on 8 April 1682. Included in the collection were the paintings inherited from his grandfather, Diego Sarmiento, Conde de Salvatierra. In the partition of the estate, Don Joseph's collection was inherited by his own son Joseph Francisco Sarmiento y Mendoza, Conde de Salvatierra. Uncharacteristically for an aristocratic collection, Salvatierra's inventory listed no series of family portraits. The most highly valued painting in the entire collection, however, was an equestrian portrait of the Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand (no. 24) by Van Dyck, worth 5,500 reales. This may have been one of the versions of Rubens's portrait of this sitter painted in 1634 (Madrid, Prado). Other royal portraits in the collection (nos. 73, 75) were valued at only a fraction of this amount. Palomino recognized that one of the paintings was a copy of Titian's St. Margaret (no. 43), probably the version at the Escorial. He also noted the distinctive hand of the Bassano family in nine pictures (nos. 2, 37, 44, 47, 69), although two paintings were copies and only one (no. 69) was explicitly stated to be an original. Interestingly, this latter painting of the Agony in the Garden may have been paired with a painting of the same size of the Supper at Emmaus (no. 70) by the Spanish Bassano, Pedro Orrente. There was a painting by the sixteenth-century artist Luis de Morales (no. 72) and a picture by Eugenio Caxés of St. Jerome Flagellated by Angels (no. 66), but the works of the younger generation of painters in Madrid are conspicuous by their absence in Palomino's valuation. There were, however, representative examples of works in the minor genres. Salvatierra owned 41 still lifes and bodegones, and five much less valuable flowerpieces; this large number was perhaps due to the need to decorate the many large rooms in his Madrid residence. No fewer than ten still lifes by Ignacio Arias were listed in the collection (nos. 3, 26). This now obscure artist was a promising still-life painter who was married in 1636 (Madrid, Parroquia de San Sebastián, Libro de matrimonios 6, f. 269v, 25 December 1636), but died prematurely in 1653. Consequently, his works may have been somewhat rare. Salvatierra's still life by Frans Snyders (no. 51), as well as his painting of the goddess Ceres with fruit (no. 23), was worth nearly twice as much as those by Arias. The difference in value is in fact consistent with aristocratic and royal taste for still lifes throughout the period. While the collection contained at least four Flemish landscapes (no. 13), valued at 50 reales each, Palomino evidently thought highly of José Antolínez's example in the genre, valuing his landscape at three times the amount (no. 22). The battle painter Juan Bautista de Toledo was represented by six examples of his specialization (nos. 14, 15, 16, 57) as well as three seascapes (no. 46). Viviano Codazzi, who was a recognized specialist in the popular genre of perspectival paintings and enjoyed a large export market, was represented by three examples in Salvatierra's collection (no. 48). While many aristocratic collectors indulged a taste for mythological subjects, Salvatierra's inventory identified only a few such paintings: Snyders' painting of the goddess Ceres, mentioned above, an unusual pair of oval paintings depicting the story of Hermaphrodite (no. 41), and a scene of nymphs hunting that may have represented Diana (no. 49).","Collectors Files:  Salvatierra, Condes de","input"

Photocopy of valuation of paintings at ff. 724v-725v.'","The combined inventory and appraisal of the estate of Don Francisco de Brizuela y Cárdenas, a knight of the Order of Santiago, Cavallero de la Reina and Corregidor de la Villa de Madrid, was drawn up by his widow, Catalina de Chaves Bañuelos, beginning on 2 October 1630. No artist was cited as having valued the small collection of paintings, which comprised 59 items. Brizuela was a courtier attached to the queen's household, and an important part of his collection consisted of images of the Habsburgs, including the Spanish kings and their queens (nos. 42-47) and the French royal family. There were also portraits of Philip III's privado, the Duque de Lerma (no. 34), the Archbishop of Toledo, García de Loaysa (no. 39), and famous historical figures, such as the Duque de Alba (no. 32) and El Cid (no. 33). Given Brizuela's capacity as corregidor of the city of Madrid, it is not surprising that he should own images of the city itself (no. 49) and the Plaza Mayor (no. 48), as well as a view of Toledo (no. 23). While 32 of the paintings in the collection represented religious subjects, three mythological subjects also appeared: two of these were copies after Titian's poesie in the Spanish royal collection, Danae and the shower of gold (no. 14), and Perseus and Andromeda (no. 15). A further painting of Diana bathing (no. 18) may also have derived from Titian's Diana and Actaeon in the Alcázar collections. One of the most intriguing subjects of all, however, was the painting of the classical artist Apelles (no. 20), the favorite painter of Alexander, a subject that would seem to reflect this collector's real appreciation of the liberal art of painting. This subject reappeared in the collection of Don Rodrigo de Herrera (Doc. 33).","Collectors Files:  Brizuela y Cárdenas, Francisco de","input"

Balbi's pictures were appraised on 3 December by two painters, Jerónimo de la Cruz y Mendoza and Francisco Fernández. Although Balbi owned only a few paintings, a mere 19 works, some were of considerable value, such as St. John the Baptist pointing upwards (no. 1) and a large Assumption of the Virgin (no. 5), both valued at 2,000 reales each. Pablo Justiniano, another Genoese at court, willed a painting of the Magdalene to Balbi (Doc. 19, no. 10). Most of the paintings were of religious subjects, including three of St. John the Baptist (nos. 1, 2, 3) and a pair of paintings representing Judith and Holofernes and Samson and Delilah (nos. 7, 8). However, Balbi also owned a painting of Cleopatra (no. 13), perhaps an erotic representation, and another less valuable picture of the goddess Diana (no. 17). As a demonstration of his loyalty to the Spanish Crown, Balbi had a portrait of Philip IV (no. 19), as well as a representation of his home town of Genoa (no. 14).","Collectors Files:  Balbi, Antonio","input"

Sale of goods ff. 11v-13, from 10 February 1651.'","The combined inventory and valuation of the estate of Antonio González Cárdena (d. 5 January 1651) was drawn up by his widow Margarita de Rebenga y Proaño, beginning in Madrid on 5 January 1651. Paintings were appraised on 4 February 1651, by the painter Antonio Arias. An unusual aspect of González Cárdena's collection is the comparatively small number of conventional religious subjects represented. There were paintings of the martyrdoms of St. Bartholomew (no. 1) and St. Lawrence (no. 27), Eden (no. 4), landscapes with the Apostles (no. 21), the Nativity (no. 24), and four landscapes with the story of the Old Testament hero Samson (no. 28). The figurative subject matter of 12 perspectival paintings is unspecified (nos. 18, 19). Paintings of Europa (no. 25) and another of a nude woman with a young man playing an organ (also included in item no. 25) may have been copies of paintings by Titian in the Spanish royal collection. The influence of the Spanish royal collection could also be reflected in González Cárdena's painting of Queen Tomyris with the Head of Ciro (no. 6), since a Flemish painting of this subject had hung in the Hall of Mirrors of the Madrid Alcázar in the 1620s (Madrid, Prado) (Orso, 1986, p. 46). The same subject is found again in the collection of Diego de Cortavila y Sanabria (Doc. 77, no. 14) as well as Miguel de Salamanca where it is called a copy after Rubens (Doc. 63, no. 9) and inventoried with four other Rubens' copies. There was a painting of sea gods (no. 5) and another of Nautilus (no. 8). The classical flavor of the collection was continued in two paintings that appear to have represented scenes from the life of Helen of Troy (no. 5). The large painting of the classical subject of gladiators (no. 2) brings to mind scenes of life in ancient Rome that decorated the royal palace of the Buen Retiro, at least one of which, by Giovanni Lanfranco, represented a Banquet with Gladiators (Madrid, Prado). An unusual painting of the Coronation of Charles V (no. 5) perhaps reflects pride in the Spanish imperial past. González Cárdena also owned a copy of a large bodegón by Frans Snyders (no. 3). Originals by this artist were sought after by the wealthiest of aristocratic collectors and may have been beyond his means. Two hunting scenes in the collection (nos. 7, 23) may also have been copies after Flemish prototypes, and would appear to reflect this collector's imitation of the taste of his noble contemporaries. There were also four modest fruit still lifes (no. 10), ten flowerpieces (nos. 12 and 22), and four still lifes with birds, sweets, fruit, and vessels (nos. 13 and 14) whose descriptions strongly suggest that they were painted by Spanish artists active at court at this time, such as Juan de Espinosa or Antonio Ponce.","Collectors Files:  González Cárdena, Antonio","input"

Will, inventory, tasación, and partition of the estate of Doña Catalina Fernández de Cardona Córdoba y Aragón, wife of Don Luis Méndez de Haro;  she died 19 November 1647.  The paintings were evaluated by Francisco Barrera on 19 May 1648 (entered 30 May).   Doña Catalina, daughter of the Duques de Segorbe y de Cardona, married Don Luis on 28 October 1624, having signed capitulaciones matrimoniales at San Lorenzo el Real (that is, El Escorial) and Madrid, 19-20 October 1624 (dowry, fols. 525 ff.).  Although she brought 100,000 ducats to the marriage (an immense sum), no paintings of value were included.  Since Don Luis did not inherit the estates of Carpio and Morente from his father until 1648, the inventory, which records their estate as of 1647, does not include his inheritance, and therefore represents their joint collecting activities from 1624 to 1647. Unfortunately, we have no way of knowing which pictures (apart from those in her dowry) were hers, which were his, and which were theirs.'

Also see MB's diss which has a partial transcription of this doc.] [García Carraffa only lists 3 children: Gaspar, Antonia and Manuela]","Luis Méndez de Haro y Guzmán was born in Valladolid in 1598, the son of Diego López de Haro, the fifth Marqués del Carpio, and of Francisca de Guzmán, Olivares' elder sister. (Eight members of the Haro family held the title of Marqués del Carpio from its inception in 1552 until its merger into the House of Alba in 1733. Haro family history is complex, involving several female heirs and a series of intermarriages with the Houses of Monterrey (Azevedo) and Olivares (Guzmán). See Paz y Espeso 1948, passim, and García Carraffa, vol. 42, 1954, pp. 293-95 and 190ff. Paz y Espeso 1948 gives 1576 as the date of Don Luis's grandparents' wedding. His mother died in 1642, his father in 1648. Note that, possibly owing to a typographical error, Paz y Espeso gives Don Luis's birthdate as 1590 instead of 1598. Cf. García Carraffa, vol. 42, 1954, p. 295.) He served in the retinue of his uncle at court, learning the statecraft that he would put to use after Olivares' fall from power in the 1640s. Don Luis married Catalina Fernández de Cardona Cordova y Aragón, a daughter of the Duque de Segorbe, on 28 October 1624, having signed capitulaciones matrimoniales at San Lorenzo el Real (that is, El Escorial) and Madrid, 19-20 October 1624 (See Saltillo 1951, p. 170 n. and Saltillo 1953, pp. 233-34, listing 34 lots only). Through his mother, Don Luis inherited the title of Marqués de Eliche, which had belonged to Olivares, although he seems to have passed this title directly to his son, Don Gaspar, who is so styled in the inventory of 1648. Don Luis eventually inherited the titles of Conde de Olivares and Duque de Sanlúcar el Mayor as well. (The extensive lawsuits over the Conde-Duque's estate are documented in Marañon 1965, pp. 477ff. The lawsuit is mentioned in Don Luis's will, AHPM, Prot. 6.292, ff. 447f.) On the death of his father in 1648, Don Luis became the 6th Marqués del Carpio and 2nd Conde de Morente. He was created Duque de Montoro in 1660 (Atienza 1959, p. 914). Don Luis succeeded his uncle, Olivares, as the válido of Philip IV. (On Don Luis's career, see J. Deleito y Pinuela, El declinar de la monarquía española, 4th ed., Madrid 1966, pp. 150-59; Elliott 1970, pp. 350-56; J. Lynch, Spain under the Hapsburgs, vol. 2, Oxford 1969, pp. 116-19, 133-37; Marañon 1965, pp. 351-63ff.; F. Tomás Valiente, Los válidos, Madrid 1963, pp. 18-20, 97-104, 182-86 (documentation). According to the information provided by Tomás Valiente, the Spanish term for favorite was privado in the first half of the seventeenth century but was replaced by válido sometime around the end of Philip IV's reign. Casal 1930 provides a brief overview of Don Luis's collecting.) The Spanish Empire, which had been on the verge of disintegration at the time of Olivares' fall, was restored to an at least superficial harmony during Don Luis's term of office, and he is credited with negotiating the peace treaty with France in 1660. The king's favor led to many lucrative court offices and other appointments, but Don Luis is said to have been particularly honest. In spite of many opportunities to enrich himself at the expense of the crown, he left massive debts upon his death in 1661. (See AHPM, Prot. 6.292, ff. 460-472. A good example of the honest reputation which has adhered to Don Luis's name may be found in the Enciclopedia Universal Ilustrada, vol. 27, 1958 (ca. 1925), p. 587. The article (inaccurate in various details) notes that Haro stimulated agriculture, arts, and letters, and asserts that he never used his privanza with the king for personal ends.) Although the art collections of the Carpio family have often been studied, most of the attention has focused on the holdings of Don Luis's son, Gaspar de Haro y Guzmán, whose many adventures made him famous in his own time (see essay of Doc. 49). If, however, the father's life cannot rival the flamboyance of the son's, the elder Carpio can claim, in addition to his political accomplishments, some merit as a collector. Indeed, his acquisitions attracted the attention of contemporaries as early as l638 (E. du G. Trapier 1967b, p. 62). Don Luis must be considered one of the most important collectors of his era, with works by the Bassani, Palma Vecchio, Schiavone, Titian, Tintoretto, Veronese, Barocci, Correggio, Gentileschi, Parmigianino, Perugino, Andrea del Sarto, Reni, and possibly Raphael and Procaccini among the Italians, as well as (by 1661) Rubens, Van Dyck, Holbein, Stanzione, Paul de Vos, and Dürer among the northerners. Among his few Spanish pieces, he may also have owned works by Bocanegra, Orrente, and possibly Murillo. The first complete record we have of the Haro family collection is the present document: an inventory taken upon the death of Don Luis's wife, Doña Catalina, in 1648 (the inventory records their joint estate). Doña Catalina had brought a dowry of l00,000 ducats to her marriage to Don Luis in 1624, and at her death her personal worth accounted for nearly half the family fortune. Her dowry, however, included no paintings of value, and since Don Luis did not come into the estates of Carpio and Morente until 1648, we may assume that the 1648 inventory documents their collecting activities from 1624 to 1648, along with his acquisitions before their marriage. Very few paintings -- about one in eight -- are attributed in the 1648 inventory. This may be explained in part by the uncontested nature of Doña Catalina's estate: no public auction was anticipated, and there was consequently little motive to establish the official authorship of each work. Even so, the lack of attributions offers a contrast to her son Don Gaspar's near-obsession with precise connoisseurship. Nor was the paucity of attributions merely the result of low values, since the unattributed entries accounted for four of the most expensive works in the collection (nos. 129, 133, 217, and 225). Fortunately, we can augment the scarce information found in the 1648 inventory. A comparison with subsequent accounts of the Carpio holdings adds several names to the list (See Burke 1984, vol. 2, the table following Document 3.1). For example, the Equestrian Portrait of the Marqués de Aytona, no. 102 in 1648, may be identified with a work attributed to Van Dyck in the 1651 and 1689 inventories of Don Gaspar de Haro (Doc. 49, no. 177 and Doc. 115, no. 235).The Christ Washing the Disciples' Feet, no. 133 in 1648, is almost certainly the canvas of the same subject by Tintoretto, no. 11 in 1689. No. 124, Balthasar Carlos in the Riding School, is by Velázquez (Ibid.. The Tintoretto (Christ Washing...) should not be confused with a second Lavatorio by Tintoretto (now in the Prado, no. 2824), purchased in England in 1654 and given to Philip IV for the Sacristy of El Escorial -- see Burke 1984, vol. 2, Document 3.4, item no. 32, and the discussion in the text.) The 1648 collection was typical among Spanish collections of the age. Over three-fifths of the works were religious, and most of the secular pieces were either portraits or the Flemish landscapes that were common in seventeenth-century Spain. The Venetian emphasis, the focus on late sixteenth-century works, and the presence of Sánchez Coello and Ribera were likewise common elements in aristocratic collections. At the same time, the 1648 Carpio collection displays a remarkable bias toward Italian art. If we subtract large landscapes, still lifes, and other decorative pieces from the number of Flemish entries, we are left with only two Van Dycks, two Breughels (themselves landscapes), and a few portraits. Of course, any argument from negative evidence is tenuous; we cannot be sure that unattributed works were not Flemish as well. But if we take only those attributed paintings that a connoisseur might value for reasons beyond purely decorative function, we find (as noted in the Introduction) that nearly three-quarters are Italian, and that most of the Spanish and Flemish artists named had strong ties to Italy: Navarrete, Velázquez, and Ribera, as well as Van Dyck (no works were given to Rubens). Before presenting the data for the 1648 inventory, however, one must pause to consider at some length other documentation for Don Luis's collecting activities. Alonso de Cárdenas has already been mentioned with regard to Don Luis's gifts to Philip IV and those for the Escorial, and with regard to the Viceroyalty of the Duque de Alcalá in Naples. His correspondence with Don Luis, preserved in the Palacio de Liria and other archives (See Palcio de Liria, Madrid, Alba Archives, caja 182-166 through 182-195; transcribed in Burke 1984, vol. 2, Documents 3.2-3.7) throws considerable light on Don Luis's acquisitions and attitudes as a collector. As Don Luis's letters imply, Cárdenas was in London from about 1638 and served as the Spanish Ambassador to Cromwell's England from about 1650 until the outbreak of war between England and Spain in 1655 made his removal to Flanders necessary. (Cárdenas' career is outlined by Alvárez y Baena 1789/1973, vol. 1, p. 53. His arrival and early activities in England are noted in S.R. Gardiner, History of England, New York 1901, vol. 8, pp. 377-387, and vol. 9, pp. 58-69. His appointment to England is announced in a draft despatch from Philip IV, dated 7 March 1638 (Simancas: Archivo Histórico Nacional, Sección Estado, legajo 2575). He had arrived in England by 16 May 1638 (legajo 2521). I am indebted to Prof. John Elliott for these references. Barrionuevo, vol. 1, 1892, p. 232 (Letter 115, 8 December 1655), reports that Cárdenas has been put under house arrest by Cromwell; on 8 January 1656 (Letter 123, p. 236), Barrionuevo asserts, ya esta en Flandes don Alonso de Cárdenas, embajador de Inglaterra, esperando orden de lo que ha de hacer.) He also served as Don Luis's personal agent in purchasing works of art from the Pembroke, Arundel, royal, and other collections. The letters in the Palacio de Liria that document Cárdenas' activities include descriptions of objects, accounts of monies spent on works of art, reports on problems of crating and shipping, and much other information (See Palcio de Liria, Madrid, Alba Archives, caja 182-166 through 182-195; transcribed in Burke 1984, vol. 2, Documents 3.2-3.7.z). Don Luis's replies are also preserved, but the disastrous fire that destroyed many of the Alba family's archives and library late in the eighteenth century badly damaged this part of the correspondence. The remaining fragments were published by the Duquesa de Berwick y Alba in 1891 (See Berwick y Alba 1891, p. 488 note 2). In spite of the relatively slow pace of communication in the seventeenth century and the concomitant necessity of allowing Cárdenas to exercise his own judgment, Don Luis was able to keep in close touch with Cárdenas' activities. He applauded Cárdenas when the ambassador had done well and informed Cárdenas of his plans for the pictures, once they had arrived in Madrid. And I assure your Honor that all of them, as regards the quality of their [authorship], have seemed to me to be very good, and at very accommodating prices, particularly the...pictures by Raphael...The Mercury by Correggio, and the Lavatorio by Tintoretto, which I judge to be very great things, of high esteem, and which will, I believe, give much pleasure to the King and particularly to me in being able to give them to him, because in spite of their being things of such small importance, yet he has a very particular inclination to painting...( Ibid., p. 488: los juzgo por una cosa muy grande y de gran estima, y con que creo que su Magd. recibirá mucho gusto, y yo muy particular en poder dársele, aunque sea en cosas de tan poca importancia, porque tiene muy particular inclinacion á la pintura undated; probably 1654). Don Luis also specified subjects and masters. He assured Cárdenas at one point that there was no need, Thank God, for any more merely devotional works (Ibid., p. 489), although he later urged the ambassador to be on the watch for devotional pictures by Rubens and Van Dyck that could serve to illustrate the life of St. Lawrence (Ibid., p. 495; 22 January 1655. Don Luis's request for works by Rubens and Van Dyck probably reflects Cárdenas' recent arrival in Flanders. See above, note 20). (Presumably both comments were related to the re-decoration campaigns at the Escorial, as discussed below.) He even specified approximate sizes (Ibid., p. 496, 3 March 1655 -- i.e., to Cárdenas in Flanders: Veo tambien cómo V.S.I. quedaba tambien con el cuidado de buscar las de Rubenes, Vandique y Guido Boloñés; y aunque no sean del tamaño que dixe primero, de qualquiera será bien...) Don Luis followed with interest Cárdenas' efforts to buy a Holy Family by Raphael from a member of Parliament, who had taken it out of the sale of Charles I's estate (See Palcio de Liria, Madrid, Alba Archives, caja 182-166 through 182-195; transcribed in Burke 1984, vol. 2, Document 3.2, item no. 9 (first mentioned in 1651); cf. Berwick y Alba 1891, pp. 491, 494-96). Finally, as we have seen, Don Luis kept Cárdenas informed of the fate of each purchase at the hands of connoisseurs -- particularly Velázquez and Nardi -- at court. For example, to the correspondence we have already cited, we may add the following comment: ... And when the King returns to San Lorenzo [i.e., the Escorial], I will have the large Madonna by Raphael in place in his quarters, with which I believe he will have to be greatly pleased. Velázquez has already seen it, and it seemed a very great thing to him, as I hope will be the case with all the rest. Thank God...[undated; probably 1654].(Unfortunately, not all of Don Luis's purchases met such acclaim; see the discussion in the Introduction.) As we have seen, Don Luis was also aware of what other nobles were doing, particularly in the case of the Conde de Fuensaldaña. The haste with which Fuensaldaña's agent, the artist David Teniers the Younger, went about his activities -- for example, leaving works with Cárdenas for shipment to Spain -- gave Don Luis an opportunity to look over Fuensaldaña's purchases. A number of the Fuensaldaña works had also been sought by Don Luis; twenty-one of them would eventually enter the Carpio collection. These included a Bassano Nativity and an Annunciation to the Shepherds, a Palma Vecchio Holy Family, Titian's Adoration of the Magi (possibly now in the Prado), a portrait and a Madonna by Andrea del Sarto, six portraits by Tintoretto, two works by Van Dyck, and four by Veronese, possibly including the Kneeling Magdalene and the Susannah and Elders now in the Prado. The Cárdenas correspondence also gives us occasional glimpses of Don Luis's personal life in the l650s. The most important event to which the documents refer is the fire which, in December 1654, badly damaged Don Luis's recently obtained palace at Santa Maria in Madrid. According to contemporary accounts, the palace and its contents suffered considerably. (Barrionuevo, vol. 1, 1892, pp. 153-55 (Letter 33, 2 December 1654). The palace, which was built by the Duque de Uceda, was across from the Church of Santa María. Barrionuevo reports rumors that the damage approached 100,000 ducats. In Letter 34, p. 159 (5 December 1654), Don Luis is said to have paid out 12,000 ducats to initiate repairs. See also Berwick y Alba 1891, p. 492 note.) Don Luis, however, tells Cárdenas that the damage was principally in the roof and that the subsequent construction was in keeping with Don Luis's already developed plans to enlarge his new home. In February of 1655, Don Luis again assures Cárdenas about the fire: ...With regard to the fire at my posada...nothing was lost...neither of any value, nor any jewel, [nor tapestry], not even a single painting; and although some of the larger [paintings] suffered a little in being taken off the walls and out of the house, the damage touched no faces. (Berwick y Alba 1891, p. 495) There follow comments on his family and his hope that his children will soon be able to reunite in his house to help him entertain the king and queen. The inventory taken upon Don Luis's death in 1661 has survived only in a fragmentary and highly suspect form in documents of the early nineteenth century, conserved in the Alba Archives at the Palacio de Liria, Madrid (Cajas 182-93 and 161-48; Supporting documents originally in the AHPM are now missing. See AHPM, Prot. 9.799ff., especially no. 9.819 and 8.976-77). The documents are three lists, each of which pretends to copy older information; all three were made up at the time of a lawsuit between the Duke of Berwick and the heirs of the 17th Duquesa de Alba, the famous Duquesa Cayetana. When Doña Cayetana died without issue in 1802, her titles passed to Berwick, who was her cousin as well as a member of the pretendent branch of the English royal family. A court battle ensued as the Duke of Berwick (now Duque de Berwick y Alba) attempted to obtain as much of Doña Cayetana's material estate as possible. Obviously, the lands, rents, castles, and other possessions pertaining to the houses of Alba, Liria, Huéscar, Carpio, Olivares, Monterrey, etc., all belonged to Berwick. But Doña Cayetana had also owned valuable property -- including the picture collection -- in her own right. This property could be willed to her legal heirs without regard to the succession of the family titles. Don Luis de Haro, in his will of 1658, attempted to integrate parts of his picture collection into the mayorazgo, or primogeniture of the House of Carpio (AHPM, Prot. 6.292, ff. 447ff). The paintings so reserved (pinturas vinculadas) thereafter became a part of the family title, like the land from which the title derived its name. By 1802, however, the memorial that Don Luis had prepared to specify which paintings were to be integrated into the estate seems to have been lost. The surviving documents in the Alba Archives formed part of the attempt by Berwick's lawyers to lay claim to any pictures in the Alba-Carpio art collection that Don Luis might have specified. Supporting documents -- originally in the AHPM -- are now missing. Indeed, the notarial archives supposedly covering this period are fragmentary (See the references in the Alba documents cited in Burke 1984, vol. 2, Documents 3.1 ff. and 3.9ff). The years l802-04 were a time of confusion in Spanish government. Might someone in power -- someone with an interest in collecting pictures -- have been able to remove documents from the protocols in order that the Carpio pictures might be pried free of the mayorazgo? A number of candidates for such an intervention exist, foremost among whom is Manuel Godoy, the Prime Minister and eventual owner of several of the Carpio pictures. Two of the inventories are obviously spurious, but one of them (located in caja 161-48) appears to be a fairly accurate reflection of Don Luis's collection, since almost all the pictures may be traced to the 1689 inventory (Doc. 115) of Don Luis's son, Don Gaspar, and many of them are the same works mentioned in the Carpio-Cárdenas correspondence. Although we cannot be sure that some of Don Gaspar's acquisitions have not crept into the list, the inventory nevertheless gives us a field within which to locate Don Luis's efforts. Among the papers of the Carpio estates in the Alba archives is another list of pictures. These were inventoried in several rooms of an unspecified palace: the rooms are the bedroom (dormitorio), large office (aposento grande), library (librería), and something called the garden (jardín), which probably meant a garden pavilion, perhaps the same jardín that Don Gaspar de Haro enlarged near the San Joaquín gate at the site of the present Palacio de Liria. The document itself is in a late seventeenth-century hand on typical seventeenth-century paper, but there is no contemporary label or context to indicate whether it relates to the estate of Don Luis de Haro or that of his son, Don Gaspar. (The notes on a number of the pictures indicating the origins of the works -- England, the Almirante, Monterrey -- may eventually yield a terminus post quem.) As indicated in the Introduction, the works on the list are principally by renowned masters of the Italian Renaissance, plus a suite of three works by Guido Reni. Could this list be Don Luis's accounting of entailed pictures? Even if the list dates from the time of Don Luis's son, Don Gaspar de Haro, enough of the works on it can be related to Don Luis's collecting activities to allow us to use it as a summary of the best in his collection. Because the Cárdenas correspondence is incomplete, and the two inventories just discussed are not firmly datable -- that is, because they cannot be considered reliable contemporary descriptions of Don Luis's collections -- they have not been transcribed here verbatim. However, the information in them has been included as annotations where practicable. Doña Catalina Fernández de Cardona Córdoba y Aragón, wife of Don Luis Méndez de Haro, died 19 November 1648. The paintings were appraised by Francisco Barrera on 19 May 1648 (entered 30 May, ff. 411v-440v) (Cited and partially transcribed in Saltillo 1951, p. 170n., and 1953, pp. 233-34, listing 34 lots only).","Collectors Files:  Carpio, Marqués del","input"

Younger brother of Juan de Borja.","Don Fernando de Borja y de Aragón was the youngest brother of Juan de Borja, 1st Conde de Mayalde, who was made Conde de Ficalho by Philip III and who owned a large picture collection of 215 works inventoried in 1600 (AHPM, Prot. 933, ff. 379v-386v; García Carraffa 1919-63, vol. 18 p. 140). Among Fernando de Borja's inherited titles was that of 3rd Conde de Mayalde and Príncipe de Esquilache (García Carraffa 1919-63, vol. 18 p. 140). He was comendador mayor of the military Order of Montesa and was Viceroy of Aragón and at the time of his death at the beginning of 1666 he also occupied the high palace offices of cavallerizo mayor of the king and his Gentilhombre de Cámara, as well as being a member of the Council of State and Council of War. His collection of paintings was valued between 10 and 15 March 1666, by the painter Juan Antonio de Escalante, who followed the attributions given to paintings in the inventory without adding any of his own. Escalante's further connection with the family is shown by his appraisal on 6 November 1658, of the collection of paintings left on the death of Francisco de Borja (1577-1658), 2nd Conde de Mayalde, 5th Príncipe de Esquilache, who was the nephew of Don Fernando de Borja and whom Vicencio Carducho mentioned among the most significant collectors at court in 1633 (AHPM, Prot. 7.650, ff. 443-446v, 447-455; García Carraffa, t. 18, pp. 141-142; Carducho, ed. 1979, p. 420). A prized work of Fernando de Borja's collection was a figure of Christ housed in a tabernacle that miraculously spoke to San Francisco de Borja and which was admired also by Cassiano dal Pozzo in 1626. In 1633 Vicencio Carducho singled out this sculpture as one of the most significant works in the collection of Francisco de Borja (Carducho, ed. 1979, p. 420; Simón Díaz 1980, p. 202). The collection was especially distinguished by its eleven Venetian old master paintings; three religious subjects attributed to Titian (nos. 45, 50, 64), which included a version of the Tribute Money; two by Tintoretto (nos. 14, 17); and six originals by the Bassani (no. 70). A Christ at the Column by Luca Cambiaso appears to have been a particularly highly esteemed painting, judging by its high value (no. 15). The only Spanish picture attributed in the appraisal was a Virgin and Child by the Valencian artist Francisco de Ribalta (1564-1628), who worked in Madrid between 1582-1598 (no. 53). It is difficult to believe that two small religious subjects attributed to Rubens were originals, given their low appraised value of 50 reales each (nos. 104, 105). A print of Raphael's Transfiguration appears to have been a particularly revered image, judging from the fact that this had been laid onto a panel and was framed and covered with a crimson curtain. There were also prints by Albrecht Dürer (nos. 10, 11), including 57 small copper plates for printing images, some of which were also by Dürer, a painting of St. Jerome (no. 62), and what appear to have been 20 framed carved panels after the Apocalypse series by the same artist (nos. 7-9). This subjects of the pictures in this collection were overwhelmingly religious, with only one mythological painting listed, which appears to have represented the Forge of Vulcan (no. 121). Not surprisingly, there were also landscapes, a bodegón (no. 125), flower paintings, and still lifes, and a painting of the famous classical bronze of the Spinario or Boy Removing a Thorn from his Foot (no. 138), also found in other collections of the time. The sets of 54 paintings of famous men (no. 13) and 12 women (no. 115) were probably older works that had been inherited with the family collections. More unusual, however, were the pair of humorous pictures representing a male and a female clown (no. 73).","Collectors Files:  Borja, Fernando de","input"

Photocopy (ii) of these valued ff. 1286v-1291v.'","Don Nicolás González de Villa (d. 3 August, 1726) was a member of the king's Council of State and secretary of the Real Junta de Obras y Bosques, concerned with the management of the royal properties. On his death, his postmortem inventory was drawn up by his widow Doña Ana María Renxifo y Guemez, and in the valuation of his property his paintings collection was appraised by the painter Pedro Calabria Escudero (5 September 1726). González de Villa's paintings had been valued by the painter Antonio Palomino in the inventory of his capital drawn up on his marriage of 28 February 1711.  The collection was biased towards Italian art, including copies after old masters, such as Correggio (no. 36) and Titian (no. 26), and original works by Sassoferrato (no. 35), Andrea Vaccaro (nos. 20) and Paolo de Matteis (no. 18). The only Spanish work atttributed in the valuation was a copy after a Holy Family by Juan Antonio de Escalante (no. 15), which was worth one-third the value of the similar subject copied after Correggio (no. 36).  The most remarkable aspect of this collection is the owner's admiration for the works of Luca Giordano, a prolific artist who must have produced many works for collectors during his time at the Spanish court between 1692-1702. González de Villa owned ten original paintings by Giordano, two works from his studio, hechas en casa de Jordan (no. 21), as well as a pair of copies after the artist (no. 23). One painting depicted the particularly Spanish subject of the Immaculate Conception (no. 2) and all of the remaining works were biblical and religious subjects carrying high values; a pair of large paintings of the story of Moses, which may have contained many figures, were valued highest in the group at 6000 reales (no. 16). Moreover, the collection of Giordano pictures reflected different aspects of the painter's practice; original subjects, two sketches (no. 19) and two paintings in which the artist imitated the style of Titian (no. 17) and Tintoretto (no. 3). Giordano's imitation of Titian was valued at 1,500 reales, while an anonymous copy after Titian (no. 26), was valued at just 120 reales.","Collectors Files:  González de Villa, Nicolás","input"

This was predominantly a collection of religious images, with a small number of secular subjects that included landscapes, still lifes, battles (some of which were painted in Flanders [no. 5]), and a disembarkation scene (no. 54). The only historical subject was a Burning of Troy, paired with an Old Testament battle painting (no. 11), and a painting of Diana and Actaeon copied after Titian (no. 57), probably from the famous poesia in the royal collection. This was the only mythological subject in the collection. Four of Vicuña's paintings were copies after Rubens (nos. 16, 17, 20), and three of these were in the form of precious small paintings on copper. One of Vicuña's paintings of saints was possibly by Juan Bautista Mayno (no. 2), while another was painted by Luca Giordano (no. 10), most probably during his years in Spain. The Immaculate Conception by the Sevillian painter Francisco de Zurbarán (no. 12) typified the devotional subjects that this artist painted for private collectors during his late career at court, 1658-64.","Collectors Files:  Vicuña, Juan Antonio, Licenciado","input"

Juan de Castáneda, Maestro Mayor de la Cienzia de las Armas de sus Caballeros Pajes de SM (d. 12/7/1694), drawn up by D. Agustin de Silva, Grefier de la Casa de la Reina Madre & D. Francisco Tovarra.  Photocopy (i) of paintings inventoried 15/7/1694. Valuation of goods from 3 August 1694.  Photocopy (ii) of valuations of paintings 3/8/1694 by Antonio Palomino.' ","The postmortem inventory of Don Juan de Castáneda (d. 12 July 1694), Maestro Mayor de la Cienzia de las Armas de sus Caballeros Pajes del Rey, was drawn up by his executors, Don Agustín de Silva, Grefier de la Casa de la Reina Madre, and Don Francisco Tovarra. His paintings were valued on 3 August 1694, by Antonio Palomino. Like many distinguished collections of the day, Castañeda's included copies after some of the most renowned foreign artists of all time. There were paintings after Bosch (no. 46), Andrea del Sarto (no. 38), Titian's Entombment (no. 6), Rubens (no. 53), and Van Dyck's Deposition (no. 50), on which was placed the highest valuation. Only one copy after a Spanish hand was listed in the collection (no. 51). However, Palomino's valuation does record a remarkable collection of some of the best Spanish artists active in the capital during Castañeda's lifetime. Palomino himself was represented by a Guardian Angel (no. 16), which, it seems, was paired with a St. Michael by José Anolínez (no. 16). There were also four examples of Antolínez's landscape painting (nos. 29, 35). Although six religious paintings by the royal painter Francisco de Herrera the Younger were listed in the collection (nos. 11, 12, 13, 25, 32, 34), the other royal painters Juan Carreño de Miranda and Francisco Rizi are highly conspicuous by their absence. Perhaps Castañeda was as partisan in his taste as Herrera was in life, deciding to collect the works of a gifted but difficult artist who was notoriously scathing about his rivals at court. The relatively small collection also included a painting of a sheep by Francisco de Zurbarán (no. 36). This painting, which probably represented the bound Agnus Dei, may have been painted by Zurbarán during his final years at court. The only painting listed by Antonio de Pereda was a Vanitas still life (no. 28). This was a genre in which the artist excelled, and Castañeda's painting had a counterpart in the near contemporary collection of Andrés de Villarán (Doc. 110 no. 44). There were original religious subjects painted by Antonio Arias (no. 8) and a now obscure artist Alonso de Mesa (ca.1627-1668) (no. 49) mentioned in Palomino's Lives (Palomino, ed. 1986, p. 215). The short-lived artists Juan Antonio de Frías y Escalante (nos. 1, 22) and Mateo Cerezo (no. 7) were also represented. A copy of Cerezo's Mystic Marriage of St. Catherine (no. 51) complemented the version by Escalante (no. 1) in the collection. Castañeda owned four religious compositions (nos. 4, 10, 20) and four perspectival paintings (no. 54) by Matías de Torres, which rivalled in numbers those by Herrera. While it is not known how this collector acquired the works in this document, if they were the result of commissions to living artists, Castañeda would have to be counted among the major patrons of his time.","Collectors Files:  Castañeda, Juan de","input"

Vespasiano Gonzaga, Duque de Guastala, Capitan General de Andalucía beginning Madrid 16 August 1679, (cont. in 1682).  Photocopy of paintings inventoried ff. 398-408, 28-29 August 1682.'[See invno 663] MLG 3/22//93 Vespasiano Gonzaga (1621-1687) was not a Duca di Guastalla, his brother Ferrante III (1618-1678) had the title and then passed it to his son Cesar in 1666.  Cesar had it until 1692 when it went to Ferrante III's cousin Vicente (1634-1714), who was married to Ferrante III's daughter, Maria Victoria Gonzaga (1659-1707) [she was his second wife].  The preceding information is from a Genealogical tree of the House of Gonzaga in the Spanish encyclopedia.  However, interestingly in García Carraffa they refer to Vespasiano as the Duque Soberano de Guastala - note Guastalla should be spelled with two Ls.  He was Gentilhombre de Cámara de los Reyes Felipe IV y Carlos II, Grande de España, Virrey de Valencia y Comendador de Villahermosa y Castrotorás en la Orden de Santiago.  María Inés was the eldest of three girls in her family and thus became the 10th Condesa de Paredes de Nava. They only had one son, José who died young so the title of Conde de Paredes de Nava went to their eldest daughter, Maria Luisa whose full name was María Luisa Manrique de Lara y Gonzaga.  As García Carraffa notes, her maternal name was placed before her paternal name for reasons of inheritance since she became the 11th Condesa de Paredes de Nava.  Tellingly she was not referred to with the Guastalla title.","On the death of María Inés Manrique de Lara, 10th Condesa de Paredes (d. 8 August 1679), her husband Don Vespasiano Gonzaga, Gentilhombre de Cámara of Philip IV and Charles II, Viceroy of Valencia and Capitán General de Andalusia, drew up an inventory of the estate, beginning in Madrid on 16 August 1679. The unfinished inventory lapsed and continued again three years later when the collection of paintings was inventoried between 28 and 29 August 1682. Interestingly, although he was styled the Duque de Guastala in the document, Vespaniano Gonzaga (1621-1687) did not possess this title. It belonged instead to his brother Ferrante III (1618-1678), Duca di Guastalla, a portrait of whom is recorded in this inventory (no. 127) (The Duca di Guastala title next passed to Ferrante III's son César in 1666; César had it until 1692, when it went to Ferrante III's cousin Vicente (1634-1714), who happened to be married to Ferrante III's daughter, Maria Victoria Gonzaga (1659-1707), his second wife). In a display of allegiance to the Spanish crown, portraits of the family members (nos. 123, 127, 128) were hung alongside royal portraits of Philip IV, his two queens, and his family (nos. 121, 122, 124), as well as the Queen Mother and Charles II (no. 125). The sheer number of pictures inventoried here typifies the scale of aristocratic collections at court. While nobles typically bought large numbers of paintings because they could, and had large properties to furnish, it is also true that many of their collections were built up over different generations. This collection numbered some 300 works. Despite the large number of religious subjects in the collection, the names of very few of their authors were specified. Two religious paintings were listed as Italian works (nos. 13, 53). There were older paintings in the style of Dürer (nos. 31, 34) and Rogier van der Weyden(?) (no. 32). A Virgin and Child was by Elisabetta Sirani (1638-1665) (no. 12), a female artist who was rare in Spanish collection inventories, and Pedro de Orrente was represented by two religious subjects (no. 49). Orrente was one of only two Spanish hands identified in the document. The other was the flower painter Gabriel de la Corte (1648-1694), who was represented by two garland pictures (no. 56). These seem to have been hung with a Flemish version of the subject (no. 55). An anonymous picture of tulips was said to be painted from nature (no. 76). It is interesting to note that Gabriel de la Corte was known to have painted garlands for other artists and for shops, but died in poverty, yet he had managed to attract the attention of this aristocratic client (Ceán Bermúdez 1800, vol. I, p. 364). The only mythological subject in the collection was said to be a copy of a Bacchus by Rubens (no. 67). Flemish painters had painted many of the decorative secular pictures too, such as two Flemish still lifes (no. 66). Among the Flemish seascapes (nos. 1, 2, 4), six were attributed to one Sebastian Pietris (no. 21). A number of the landscapes were described as Flemish works (nos. 6, 9), along with four Italian examples (no. 20). One set of 12 landscapes on panel was painted by Joos de Momper (1564-1635) (no. 3). Another, despite being ordinary, was attributed to one Gabriel Brueghel (no. 7). There was at least one battle picture by the Neapolitan specialist Aniello Falcone (no. 11). One of the perspectival pictures was also said to be an Italian painting (no. 27), while others listed anonymously may have been Spanish.","Collectors Files:  Paredes, Condes de","input"

Photocopy of inventoried paintings ff. 24-30, 14-18/5/1716.'","The postmortem inventory of Don Diego Jaraba (d. 22 April 1716), Organista Mayor de la Real Capilla, was begun by his widow Teresa Núñez de Rivadeneira on 29 April 1716. His picture collection, inventoried between 14-18 May, comprised some 105 paintings, mostly of religious subjects on canvas and other supports, including panel, copper, stone, and glass. Five pictures were listed as being from the oratory (nos. 57-61). The high proportion of religious subjects perhaps reflected Jaraba's devout nature, appropriate for the organist of the royal chapel. Although almost all of the paintings had frames made of carved and gilded wood or ebony, the absence of attributions and appraised values for the pictures makes it difficult to assess the paintings' quality. The document lists 21 pure landscapes, and three overdoor landscapes with birds and animals (nos. 5, 6). Jaraba also appears to have enjoyed landscape paintings with religious subjects, of which he owned many examples. A set of six saints in landscapes were described as being painted on alabaster panels (no. 52). Although no mythological narratives with large figures were listed, Jaraba did own a group of four fables also in landscape settings (no. 48). Jaraba's collection of portraits directly reflected his long career in royal service. There was a portrait of Philip IV (no. 1), another of his widow, Mariana of Austria, the Queen Mother (no. 2), and one of the popular prince Don Juan José de Austria (no. 2). Perhaps some contact with the papal court explained his portrait of Pope Innocent XI (no. 31). One family portrait was a full-length of Jaraba's uncle, the Ciego de Daroca (no. 4), who was perhaps also a musician. Surely, however, one of the most prized pictures in his collection was a large work representing Jaraba himself giving a clavichord lesson to Charles II's queen, María Luisa of Orleans (1679-1689), a work that celebrated the sitter's professional success and status at court. Unfortunately, the author of this remarkable portrait was not named in the document.","Collectors Files:  Jarava, Diego","input"

Manuel Ponce de León, Duque de Arcos, deceased, drawn up by his son D. Joaquin Ponce de León, Duque de Arcos beginning with goods at court, Madrid 5/12/1693. Valuation of paintings ff. 122v-130v, 16 January 1694, by Alonso del Arco painter (w/ a carpenter/gilder for frames).  Photocopy of paintings ff. 123-130v.' ","The postmortem combined inventory and valuation of the estate of Don Manuel Ponce de León, Duque de Arcos, was drawn up by his son and heir Don Joaquín Ponce de León, Duque de Arcos, and was begun at court on 5 December 1693. The appraisal of the paintings collection was undertaken by the painter Alonso del Arco on 16 January 1694, with the picture frames valued by a carpenter and a gilder. The first 15 paintings listed in Arco's valuation were large hunting scenes, two of which were explicitly stated to be original works by the Flemish painter Paul de Vos (nos. 1, 5). Ten of the paintings were denoted as originals and three as copies (nos. 7, 8, 12), although all of the paintings were valued at roughly the same amounts, around 1,000 reales each. Some of the best-known Spanish artists were represented among the religious paintings in the Arcos collection, including Luis de Morales (no. 26) and El Greco (nos. 21, 22, 60). Two paintings were by younger artists; one was a Susanna and the Elders by Antonio de Pereda (no. 81), and another was the Virgin of the Sagrario by Carreño de Miranda (no. 23) A portrait of Father Charles Spínola (no. 62) may have been painted by Andrés Smidt in Madrid between 1660-80. There were examples of some specialized genres, including a perspective of the Roman Campidoglio by Viviano Codazzi (no. 19), a grape still life by Juan Fernández El Labrador (no. 41), and flowerpieces by Mario dei Fiori (no. 42). In addition there were five depictions of the sugar factory at Manilva (nos. 55, 76, 77), one of which (no. 76) was a highly valued painting, worth 8,000 reales plus 150 reales for its frame. One of the more unusual features of this valuation of Arcos' collection is the consistent discrimination between original paintings and copies. Remarkably, the number of copies slightly outnumbered the number of original. The valuation included 12 copies after paintings famous old masters such as Titian (no. 49), Veronese (no. 82), Bassano (no. 52), and Correggio (no. 36), as well as El Greco (no. 60). Others were after seventeenth-century Italian painters, Guercino (57), Mola (59), and Stanzione (no. 78), with two copies after a Ribera, a philosopher (no. 58) and a version of his Apollo and Marsyas (no. 110). There were two further copies after as yet unidentified artists (nos. 50, 75). Only in the case of one picture were the authors of both original and copy identified: a portrait of Venus copied after Titian by Juan Bautista del Mazo, which was not valued very highly (no. 109). In this document, anonymity was the rule. Indeed, in the case of 37 paintings denoted as originals the author is not mentioned. More curious still, 53 paintings specified as copies mention neither the author of the prototype nor the copyist.

Photocoy of paintings inventoried ff. 159-163v.'","The postmortem inventory of Catalina de Alvarado was drawn up in 1669 by her husband Don Juan de Torres y Barrantes, a familiar of the Inquisition, on behalf of their daughters Da Bernauela and Da Catalina de Torres y Alvarado. This collection contained paintings by contemporary Spanish artists, as well as some older painters such as El Greco, and a number of old master pictures. The attributions to Parmigianino (no. 45), Titian (no. 50), and Tintoretto (no. 52) may have been optimistic. There was a small collection of portraits, some apparently by famous artists (nos. 49-56). Among the religious paintings in the collection was a painting of the young Virgin by Francisco de Zurbarán (no. 17), which was probably painted during the artist's final years at court, 1658-64. Two landscapes with religious subjects were identified as by Eugenio Caxés. Alvarado also owned a religious painting on copper (no. 25) and small landscapes (no. 77) by licenciado Pedro García Ferrer, who was also a priest and whom Lázaro Díaz del Valle considered an outstanding artist (pintor de los lucidos desta [corte]) (Díaz del Valle, ed. 1933, p. 392; Ceán Bermúdez, 1800, t.II, p. 164). Seascapes and fruit still lifes painted by Morán, an artist who is most probably to be identified with Santiago Morán (nos. 64, 73), also illustrate the fact that Spanish artists at court diversified their production and worked in various genres for the private market. One of the more remarkable works in the collection, however, was a collaborative painting (no. 35), a depiction of the sleeping Christ Child by the short-lived figure painter Mateo Cerezo, with the surrounding garland by the flower painter Juan de Arellano. This painting had a northern counterpart in the collection, a painting with figures by David Teniers and flowers by the specialist Frans Ijkens (no. 65). There were four more flower paintings said to be signed by Arellano (no. 96); another flower painting was from the school of Mario Nuzzi (no. 57), the Italian master from whom Arellano was reputed to have derived his own style. Indeed, this collection displayed a particular taste for flower paintings and still lifes; there were 13 flowerpieces listed and 18 still-life paintings by Spanish and foreign artists, Four Seasons in flowers and fruit (no. 58), and a painting of a hare attributed to Albrecht Dürer (no. 69). Despite De Torres' being a familiar of the Inquisition, his and his wife's collection included at least one Venetian erotic mythological subject, Venus with Cupid (no. 62) listed as school of Titian. There were also paintings of the stories of Perseus and Andromeda attributed to Parmigianino (no. 45), Dido and Aeneas (no. 68), Jason and Medea (no. 70), and Narcissus (no. 70), which suggest the educated taste of their owners. Two Flemish landscapes with the stories of Icarus and Ganymede (no. 95) may have been considered suitable pendants because of their depiction of airborne figures.","Collectors Files:  Alvarado, Catalina de","input"

[Probably the partition lists should be input rather than the valuation]","Gregorio Díaz de Quevedo y Barroso (d. 22 July 1680) was contador in the Consejo de las Órdenes and administered the tax of the media anata of the ecomiendas of the military Order of Santiago. He was not himself noble, but, judging from the postmortem inventory of his estate drawn up by his children and heirs, appears to have been wealthy. (J. L. Barrio Moya published the attributed paintings in this inventory, as well as the library in: La librería y algunas pinturas de Don Gregorio Díaz de Quevedo, Contador de Carlos II en el Real Consejo de Ordenes, Revista Antiquaria, no. 10 (1985), pp. 40-43). His paintings were valued on 8 August 1680, by a painter, Francisco de Lizona (ff. 33-35). The collection of nearly 50 pictures comprised mostly religious subjects, except for six landscapes (no. 21) and paintings of the Senses and Continents by a single hand (no. 18). The document distinguishes between paintings on metal, most probably on copper, and those on stone (nos. 6, 14), wood panel, and canvas supports. There were also two figures of Christ  painted on wooden crosses (nos. 19, 20), one of which was by Diego Polo (no. 19), who painted in a neo-Titianesque manner. The only other attributed paintings were also the most highly valued works in the collection (along with an anonymous Immaculate Conception, worth 1,500 reales [no. 12]). These were six copies on copper after religious subjects by Rubens, worth 1,500 reales each (no. 2), and four paintings said to be originals from Italy by Guercino, which were worth more than twice this amount (no. 1). Despite their disparate religious subjects, they were entered together as a group of paintings of the same size. While the large number of religious paintings in a small collection such as this suggests that their owner prized the devotional function of art, the attributions to artists of the caliber of Guercino, Rubens, and Polo also suggests that he was also not unaware of aesthetic merits.","Collectors Files:  Díaz de Quevedo y Barroso, Gregorio","input"

Don Iñigo and his brother Beltrán Manuel de Guevara y Tassis, General de las Galeras de Sicilia y Nápoles were the heirs of the estate. There are two sets of original numbers given in the document. The first set (900 - 1100 range) seems to have been assigned when the valuation was made; they appear for the most part in sequential order in the document transcribed here. The second set of numbers (200 - 400 range) appears to have been assigned in the inventory.

Most of collection went to mayorazgo founded by Zavala.'","The postmortem inventory of the estate of the Basque merchant Juan Bautista de Zavala was drawn up by his widow María de Castellanos and Don Domingo Ruíz de Mazmela, knight of the Order of Santiago and royal secretary. The valuations of Zavala's goods in Madrid began on 1 July 1682, with the paintings appraised by the painter and royal architect Don Francisco de Herrera on 3 July (Zavala's valuation of pictures as well as his testament are published in J.L. Barrio Moya, El comerciante guipuzcoano Don Juan Bautista de Zavala y el inventario de sus bienes (1682), Boletín de la Real Sociedad Vascongada de los Amigos del País (1988), pp. 185-204). Zavala's estate was partitioned among his heirs by a document signed on 4 August 1684, in which most of his picture collection was entailed to a mayorazgo founded by the deceased in his testament of 19 January 1682. In his testament, Zavala made a bequest of money for the marriage of girls of his lineage in Salinas de Leniz, the town where he was born.  The painting that headed Herrera's appraisal was a large picture of a wedding ceremony around the ancient tree of Guernica (no. 1), which was probably a subject close to the heart of this Basque collector living at court. Although the collection valuation listed portraits of Philip IV and Queen Isabella (nos. 3, 4), the Conde-Duque de Olivares (no. 75), and the Queen of Hungary (no. 45), it identified no portraits of Zavala and his own family. Zavala's two relatively valuable paintings of the Alcázar of Toledo (no. 42) and the city of Toledo (no. 51) must reflect his Toledan connections, either through family or business. Although Francisco de Herrera did not give the authors of any of Zavala's paintings, the comparatively high values of some of these suggest that they were of considerable quality. Herrera was one of the most cultivated artists at the Spanish court, but he did not choose to exercise his learning and experience to clarify the subject matter of six paintings in the valuation (nos. 2, 7, 16, 28, 34, 55). However, this may be a consequence of the inventory process itself -- the ignorance of the scribe rather than the artist; the list of paintings to be appraised was copied from the inventory and in the absence of Herrera, who simply appended his valuations to a ready-prepared document. One painting, described as a woman with an arrow and a headdress of a half moon (no. 2), probably represented Diana. The literal description of another with a nude woman beside a fountain and two old men behind (no. 7) suggests the story of Susanna and the Elders. Another two paintings representing nude figures (nos. 16, 34) may have dealt with more obscure allegorical or mythological subjects. The figure of Death with his scythe in another painting (no. 61) was, however, unmistakable to all concerned.","Collectors Files:  Zavala, Juan Bautista de","input"

In the valuation of his estate (ff. 527-577v) the paintings were appraised by the painter Santiago Morán on 21 August 1657 (ff. 548-555v). Jiménez de Arellano owned copies in lieu of originals by two of the most famous Spanish artists, Pedro de Orrente and Jusepe de Ribera. Three copies after philosophers by Ribera (no. 11), valued at 132 reales each, were listed along with two further paintings of philosophers in pearwood frames worth 3,000 reales, but inventoried anonymously (no. 10). Four paintings of the Creation of the World by an unidentified artist, Rodela (no. 25), which would be of considerable interest if known today, set the theme of nature as God's creation. Other paintings in the collection could be seen as further celebrations of this fact, such as allegories of the Four Elements (no. 8), still lifes (nos. 6,7, 23) and landscapes. However, the collection reflects a taste for landscape pictures, which probably owed as much to the decorative appeal of this genre as any deeper significance. Four of the first five paintings of the appraisal were a set of four landscapes with Old Testament subjects (nos. 1 and 3-5) and, although these were not valuable works, they found an echo in two copies after Pedro Orrente of the stories of Rachel and Balaam (nos. 19, 24). Six landscapes listed by Cristobal are more likely to have been works by Cristobál de Azevedo than Cristobál Vargas, nicknamed El Sevillano (nos. 20, 27), and there were a further ten landscapes listed anonymously (nos. 21, 26). The painting of the Month of September copied after Orrente probably also depicted figures involved in rural activities in a landscape (no. 18). While a painting of Paul the Hermit (no. 8) represented nature as a religious retreat, a painting of a shepherd and shepherdess (no. 26) perhaps extolled the more purely pleasurable dimension of the countryside celebrated in classical and contemporary literature.","Collectors Files:  Jiménez de Arellano, Arthanasio","input"

Pedro de Arce inherits all the pictures.'","Pedro de Arce was born in Madrid and was baptized in the parish of San Miguel on 1 March 1607 (Archivo del Palacio, Madrid, Sección de Registros, expedientes personales (empleados), caja 64, f. 64). His father was Don Juan II de Arce, a native of the small mountain village of Espinosa de los Monteros, which guards the passes between Burgos and the northern coastal province of Santander. His mother, Doña Juana Bautista Portilla, came from Alcalá de Henares (Ibid.; Pérez Balsera 1932-1936, vol. 6, pp. 142-146). Arce himself described his forebears as being en posesión de personas hijos de algo nobles -- that is, he was descended from what the English would call the gentry (Archivo del Palacio, Madrid, Sección de Registros, expedientes personales (empleados), caja 64). Arce's father (or grandfather) may have been the Juan de Arze, platero, who was recorded among those giving donativos to Philip IV in 1625. Regardless, Don Pedro maintained close connections with silver, gold, and jewelry merchants throughout his life (AHPM, Prot. 8.228). Natives of Espinosa de los Monteros held the privilege of serving as one of the monteros de cámara (also given as monteros de guarda). This office, which apparently descended from some sort of alpine troops, as the suffix de guarda indicates, should probably not be equated with that of royal huntsman, which the modern meaning of the word montero suggests. At any rate, by the seventeenth century the post was in fact more ceremonial than military. Arce's contemporary, Nuñez de Castro, tells us that the forty monteros y guardas del cámara del Rey attended upon and slept near the royal bedchambers and that they received great privileges, apparently including the right to sell offices (títulos de leales) (A. Nuñez de Castro, Libro histórico-político, 2nd ed., Madrid 1669, p. 128; also cited by Caturla 1948, p. 292). Most importantly, the monteros lived essentially tax-free, being particularly exempt on the alcabala tax on any goods which they sold. Although the salary for the post was relatively low -- only 725 reales per year, of which only 703 were actually paid, when payment could be secured at all -- the tax exemption and other privileges, as well as the proximity to the king's person and therefore to royal power and court appointments, made being a montero de cámara extremely attractive. (See Archivo del Palacio, Sección de Registros, expedientes personales (empleados), caja 64, 1-2; payments of Arce's salary were constantly in arrears). Thus, Arce, in 1643, bought one of the forty positions from Don Juan de Rozzo or Rozas Escalera (Santiago) for 1,200 ducats, or more than eighteen years' salary (Caturla 1948, p. 292; cf. the comments appended to Burke 1984, vol. 2, Document 5.65, where the figure is given as 1,000 ducats). Arce's pruebas de sangre were certified and the case reviewed and (presumably) approved by 18-21 August 1643 (Archivo del Palacio, Madrid, Sección de Registros, expedientes personales (empleados), caja 64). Like Velázquez, Arce worked his way up the court hierarchy. He was also an ensayador de la casa de la moneda -- an assayer and inspector in the Royal Mint, an office that was only marginally compatible with Arce's status as an hidalgo. (It would later cause difficulties for his son's nomination to a military order. See Caturla 1948, p. 292, who cites information from the Marqués de Montesa.) In 1664, Don Pedro applied for the position of guardajoyas, an office that would have proved particularly lucrative to anyone with Arce's connections in the jewelry industry. Arce was apparently passed over for the post, but in transmitting Arce's request to the Bureo, or palace executive committee, Philip IV indicated that he knew Arce fairly well, insisting that the Bureo consult with the king about the merits of Arce's services and parts whenever the king should come to propose subjects for him (Proponerme sujetos para el -- that is, tasks or offices? -- Archivo del Palacio, Madrid, Sección de Registros, expedientes personales (empleados), caja 64, 1-2). As Arce had already become an important collector by this time, we may speculate that his taste for art was among the parts that recommended him to the king. In 1676, Arce is described as a procurador en Cortes (a solicitor or representative) of the parish of Santa Cruz in Madrid; some time before, he had also become an aposentador of the palace (Pérez Balsera 1932-1936, vol. 6, pp. 142-146; also cited by Caturla 1948, p. 292). Arce probably obtained the latter position in 1667, when he petitioned the king to transfer his office of montero to his son, Don Pedro Ignacio de Arce (AHPM, Prot. 8.224, f. 775). Other documents locate Don Pedro's homes during this same period: he is said to have lived on the Calle del Barrionuevo in 1642 and on the Calle de las Carretas, in the houses of Don Pedro de Velasco, Capellán de honor to the king, in 1651. Arce's death date is not known, but he seems to have still been alive at the time of his son's admission into the Order of Santiago in 1678; he would have been seventy-one years old in that year. Investigations into Arce's history are complicated by the existence of many people with the same family name in seventeenth-century Madrid. What is more, a second Pedro de Arce -- a contemporary of the collector -- played a prominent role in the government circles of the Conde-Duque de Olivares. Archivo del Palacio, Madrid, Sección de Registros, expedientes personales (empleados), caja 64, 1-2 contains a decreto of Philip IV, dated 17 November 1646, stemming from an edict forbidding court ministers to receive salaries from overlapping multiple appointments. He stops payment to a Pedro de Arce for the wages (300,000 m. per year) due him as Secretary to the late Queen, that is, Doña Isabel, Philip's first wife. This document probably refers to the Don Pedro de Arce who was a follower of Olivares, witnessing Olivares' wife's will on 10 September 1647 (AHPM, Prot. 6.233, f. 643v where the signature is different than that of the collector.) The Secretary Don Pedro de Arce also rented certain houses left by the Doctor Bautista Leoni on 13 December 1624 (AHPM, Prot. 2.676, f. 401), when the collector would have been only seventeen years old. Since Arce lived so long into the lifetime of his son, Don Pedro Ignacio, there exists the possibility of further confusion, although this has not yet been a problem. The son is, however, of some interest in his own right. In addition to inheriting his father's positions at court and in the Mint, he would presumably have inherited the picture collection as well. Furthermore, Pedro Ignacio was a playwright and counted the famous dramatist, Calderón de la Barca, among his friends. Calderón, in fact, testified in the younger Arce's behalf during his pruebas de sangre in 1678 (Pérez Balsera 1932-1936, vol. 6, pp. 142-146). Don Pedro de Arce was married at least twice. His first wife, whom he married on 20 December 1642 (when he was already thirty-five years old), was Doña Maria Tofiño de Vallejo, the widow of Don Tomás de Rueda, a jewelry merchant who had died in 1637 (Ibid.; AHPM, Prot. 8.228). Doña María herself died on or before 17 March 1657. Inventories taken at the time of Rueda's death, at the time of Arce and Doña María's wedding in 1643, and at Doña María's death in 1657 are all preserved in the Madrid archives. Also preserved are the documents relating to Arce's second marriage, in 1664, to Doña Luisa Ordóñez de Rueda, widow of Don Antonio de Oviedo y Herrera of the Order of Santiago. These documents include Arce's 1664 inventory, which was published in part by Caturla, and a 1666 inventory of paintings and other goods that came into Arce's power as part of his second wife's dowry. Taken together, the documents not only outline the history of Arce's collection, but also provide valuable insights into the financial and private lives of an upper middle class seventeenth-century family. Although Arce's wealth could hardly be compared to that of the great nobles, it was nevertheless quite substantial. For example, at the time of Arce's first marriage in 1643, his personal estate was appraised at nearly two million maravedíes, or about 5,000 ducats. His first wife brought him nearly a million maravedíes in her dowry, and her sons by her first husband brought several millions more into the common household, to be held in trust by Arce until they were of age. The value of the entire combined estate in 1657 was over ten million maravedíes (over 27,000 ducats), of which Don Pedro's portion was 5,530,467.50 maravedíes (over 14,000 ducats, including the assets he had brought to his marriage in 1643). By 1664, at the time of his second marriage, Arce's net worth was estimated at 316,718 reales de vellón and 520,704 reales de plata. That is, he possessed an estate of 66,000 to 75,000 ducats. Of course, this included investments yielding yearly income -- his salary, rents, debts collectible, and the like -- which were appraised at arbitrary values, as in the case of his office of montero de cámara, appraised at the purchase price of 1,200 ducats depending on whether the deflationary decree of 1664 had actually taken place. Nevertheless, Arce's wealth was for the most part in cash (nearly 4,600 ducats, all in silver) or, more remarkably, in jewels (nearly 29,000 ducats), which Arce could sell without paying tax, as a result of the privileges inherent in his office of montero de cámara. Since this was at a time when the large noble estates were increasingly encumbered by debts and by the costs of maintaining large households, and mainly consisted in any case of rents and agricultural income, in terms of liquid assets Arce was able to keep up with the grandees in the same court circles. It seems clear that the ultimate source of Arce's wealth was commerce in jewels, silverware, and other precious objects. Whether or not Arce's father was in fact the platero mentioned in the documents (AHPM, Prot. 2.677), Arce's wife was certainly the widow of a jewel merchant. It could hardly have been a coincidence that Arce's first marriage preceded, and the receipt his wife's sizeable dowry coincided with, his certification as montero de cámara, an office that had cost him nearly a fifth of his estate. What is more, the five- to sevenfold increase in his wealth between 1657 and 1664 must surely have included an inheritance, presumably from someone with a great many jewels and silver. We know that Arce sold jewels to the Marqués de la Capilla during 1654-57 (Ibid., Document 5.64e), and that he and his second wife rented out a store on the Calle Mayor to a jewelry merchant named Juan Mateo in the 1660s (Ibid., Document 5.66d). Furthermore, at the time of the pruebas de sangre for his son's admission into the Order of Santiago, Arce was said to have always exercised his post as Assayer of the Royal Mint with a sword at his side, to demonstrate that he was neither a platero nor an artesan -- the implication being that he might otherwise have been thought a platero. Arce also functioned as a businessman, managing his own properties along with those of his two wives and their children. An unusual and, as Caturla has noted (Caturla 1948, p. 294), somewhat touching insight into Arce's handling of his wives' business affairs is provided by a passage in his first wife's will, which reads as follows: I likewise declare that the aforesaid Don Pedro de Arce...has not yet authorized a receipt for my dowry because the dowry goods which entered into his power have not been sufficiently liquidated, and this because although in the estate portion (hijuela) of the aforesaid partition between myself and my sons by my first marriage different quantities and effects were judicially given over to me, many of them have turned out to be uncertain, and Don Pedro has not been able to secure payment of them, in spite of the diligent actions which he has taken. And other portions of my dowry were already paid up and spent at the time at which my second marriage, to the aforesaid Don Pedro de Arce, was contracted, and Don Pedro, with great care and many expenses and personal oversight, has been able to attain the setting in good order of many of the aforesaid properties, and if it had not been for his assistance, expense, and intelligence -- having given in every way what he had to the common household -- the properties would have been lost. (Caturla 1948, p. 304;AHPM, Prot. 8.228, ff. 420-24; notarized copy of a document in Prot. 8.222, f. 623ff.) Doña María's will is of further interest for the light it sheds both on Don Pedro's personality and on his complicated family situation, which occasionally affected his collecting activities. Doña María obviously had a great deal of affection for Don Pedro, since in place of the usual formulas (my most dear and loving husband and the like), her will speaks of the great satisfaction which she had had in Don Pedro. She repeatedly exhorts her sons by her first marriage to come to a peaceful settlement with Don Pedro, avoiding lawsuits and unpleasantries, and declares that Don Pedro will not defraud the aforesaid my sons in anything which would pertain to them and ought to be theirs. Doña María's exhortations were apparently needed, since the records of the 1657 partition of her estate between Arce and his stepsons are extremely complicated. In the first place, the settlement papers take up an entire protocol (a volume of more than 1,000 pages) -- that is, an amount of notarial space usually reserved for the partition of large noble estates (AHPM, Prot. 8.228). The very extent of these proceedings, and the meticulous care with which pertinent financial data were recorded, suggest that Arce and his wards may have been bickering over details of the inheritance. On the other hand, the disarray in which Arce found his wife's property and the complicated legal situation of an estate held in trust for the heirs of a previous marriage may have led to a difficult partition even if all sides acted in the best of faith. In any case, Arce found himself owing over 1,300,000 maravedíes to his son and stepsons, and he was forced to turn over several paintings by Angelo Nardi to one of his wards in the later stages of the settlement (Ibid., ff. 335-37). By 1664, however, Arce's assets were more formidable, and he had bought these paintings back for his own collection (See Doc. 75, nos. 41-45). Indeed, quite a few of the paintings and sculpture belonging outright to the Rueda heirs appear in Arce's inventory of 1664. Presumably, Arce had bought these pieces from his stepsons or otherwise prevented them from leaving his house. Furthermore, Arce appears to have learned from his experience: we will see that he was not only very careful to have his own estate in good order upon contracting his second marriage but also may even have manipulated property values to obtain a more favorable financial status for himself in the new common household. See also the discussion of Arce's collection in the entry for his 1664 inventory, Document 75.","Collectors Files:  Arce, Pedro de","input"

Andrés de la Torre, beginning Madrid 1 Septembery 1674. Photocopy (i) of inventory of paintings 1-2 September 1674.  12 September 1674, the Marquesa de Casaliche says that during her marriage to the above, she inherited from her mother Da Micaela de Trasmiera some goods, inventoried here.","The postmortem inventory of the goods of the secretary Don Diego de la Torre (d. 27 August 1674), knight of the Order of Santiago, was drawn up by his widow María de Saraoz, Marquesa de Casaliche, and executors Don Andrés de la Torre and Don Francisco Ignacio de Trasmiera, regent of the Consejo de Italia, beginning on 1 September 1674. Diego de la Torre took over the office of Secretario de Estado, pertaining to Italy, in October 1669 on the death of Blasco de Loyola (Doc. 85). In November 1669, he was made Secretary of State for the North and occupied the office until his death. A set of four paintings of the Sack of Antwerp in De la Torre's collection (no. 61) directly related to his responsibilities for northern affairs, as perhaps did a picture of a Flemish battle (no. 85) and a painting of a battle of the King of Spain (no. 84). A portrait of Philip IV (no. 107) in the inventory was a mark of loyalty to the sovereign, who was the ultimate source of advancement at court. Although he was ennobled by admission into the military Order of Santiago, Torre's social aspirations culminated in a spectacular marriage to a titled member of the aristocracy, the Marquesa de Casaliche. The extensive collection of paintings was inventoried between 1 and 2 September and the appraisal of the collection was undertaken between 14 and 15 November 1674 by the painter Matías de Torres. On his marriage to María de Saraoz, Diego de la Torre's own collection was swelled by more than 80 paintings she inherited from her mother, Micaela de Trasmiera. (These correspond to nos. 100-150 of the inventory.) Both the inventory and the appraisal of this impressive collection are transcribed because many pictures are given artist attributions in one document and not the other. Moreover, a number of important paintings were listed in the inventory as a part of Torres's mayorazgo and consequently inalienable property. These did not appear in the painter's appraisal of the collection, which assigned values only to those paintings that could be sold by public auction. Diego de la Torre owned a remarkable collection of ten paintings by Jusepe de Ribera (nos. 2-4, 7, 10-14, and 16), which comprised an Immaculate Conception (no. 4), a biblical narrative from the story of Jacob (no. 2), and eight pictures of saints. It is testimony to the esteem in which this artist was held, and, the great value of the paintings, that all were entailed to De la Torre's estate. The other attributed paintings in the inventory assigned to the mayorazgo were a Virgin by Raphael (no. 68), a rustic scene by Bassano (no. 1), and a Judith by Rubens (no. 5). A copy of the last painting in the inventory (no. 150) was listed in the valuation (Doc. 92, no. 40) worth 1,000 reales. Five other anonymous religious subjects were entailed to the estate along with a portrait of a gypsy, two flowerpieces, and a perspective painting (no. 88). Remarkably, apart from Ribera, the only other Spanish artist named in the documents was Francisco Pérez Sierra, a painter active in Madrid in the second half of the seventeenth century who painted two battle pictures (Doc. 91, no. 33 and Doc. 92, no. 15) and a painting of the archangel St. Michael (Doc. 91, no. 51 and Doc. 92, no. 30). The inventory listed paintings by three of the most famous masters of the Italian Renaissance, Raphael (nos. 68, 92, 95), Parmigianino (no. 67), and Titian (no. 91). Apart from the entailed Raphael Madonna (no. 68), there was a copy of the Madonna of the Fish in the Prado (no. 9), one of the most famous Raphaels in the royal collection, which had come to Spain in 1658 with the Viceroy of Naples, the Duque de Medina de las Torres. A Christ Carrying the Cross (no. 92) said to be by Raphael was the most highly valued painting in the appraisal (Doc. 92, no. 67), worth 6,000 reales, and was perhaps a version of the Fall on the Road to Calvary in the Prado. It was protected by a curtain hanging in front of it, as was the Ecce Homo by Titian which may have hung near it (no. 91), valued at 1,100 reales (Doc. 92, no. 66). It is surprising, perhaps, that pictures of this importance should not also have been entailed to the estate.

His postmortem inventory was begun by his widow Leonor María de Saavedra in Madrid on 18 July 1670. The inventoried paintings (ff. 604-608v) were valued by Pedro de Villafranca, entitled Pintor de Su Magestad, on 29 May 1671 (ff. 575v-582v). Valle de la Zerda's collection numbered well over 100 pictures, and although Villafranca assigned many of these high values, he did not attribute any to specific artists. There were large numbers of landscape paintings, at least one of which was described as Flemish (no. 95), as was a battle painting (no. 30). Five of the landscape pictures depicted scenes of banditry (nos. 15, 40, 83, 100, 102), a subject that characterized the work of many northern painters, and especially Salvator Rosa, among Italian artists. Five large hunting scenes, subjects sought after by aristocratic collectors at court and most probably Flemish in origin, were appraised at high sums (nos. 1, 4, 16, 17). Valle de la Zerda appears to have had a taste for classical and mythological subjects: at least two of his paintings depicted the common theme of the Loves of the Gods (nos. 13, 82). One represented the story of Pyramus and Thisbe (no. 99), another of Helen of Troy (no. 37) and two more unusual paintings the Fable of Pegasus (no. 12) and the Fable of Icarus (no. 84). A more exotic note was struck by a pair of paintings representing Amazons (no. 35) and two paintings of Moors in a religious procession (no. 90) and at a Moorish banquet (no. 92).","Collectors Files:  Valle de la Cerda, Jerónimo","input"

The inventoried pictures (ff. 521v-522) were valued on 29 October by the painter Juan de Espinosa (ff. 546-548). The Italian paintings and objects listed in Monje's small collection suggest that he had spent time in the foreign service in Sicily. The inventory specifies that a set of large perspective paintings were painted in Palermo (no. 1). Six landscape paintings were identified as the work of the Palermo painter Giuseppe Costantino (no. 4), and paintings of Christ and the Samaritan Woman (no. 2) and Christ before Pilate (no. 3) were said to be both copied from originals in Palermo by one Bruno. Two screens (nos. 6, 7) had also been made in Naples and Termenes (Sicily), respectively. Monje's particular taste for landscape paintings had also led him to acquire a set of 12 works by Don Lorenzo de Soto (ca. 1634-ca. 1685), a Madrid-based specialist in this genre, which were listed in his inventory (Doce Paises de Arboledas Y figuras echos en madrid por Dn lorenzo de sotto de dos Varas en m.co Negro) but which were, inexplicably, omitted from Espinosa's valuation of the collection. The paintings listed as four Paisses de flandes (no. 5) were most probably four still-life paintings of an oblong format (apaisado), which were listed in the inventory depicting musical instruments, fruit, clothing, and arms.","Collectors Files:  Monje, Manuel","input"

However in the valuation, the subjects of assigned item nos. 41 and 44 were miscopied from the inventory - that is he misread his earlier writing.  These two items have the correct subject (as written in the inventory) added in brackets.","The postmortem inventory of Doña Ana María de Lezama (d. 28 August 1678) was begun by licenciado D. Francisco Muñoz, a presbyter of Sigüenza Cathedral, in Madrid from 5 September 1678. (This document cited, but not reproduced, in Janine Fayard, Los miembros del Consejo de Castilla (1621-1746), Madrid, 1982, p. 424. Lezama's inventory and valuation were written by the same notary, who simply copied his earlier picture descriptions in the inventory for the valuation transcribed here. Items 41 and 44 were miscopied from the inventory -- that is, he misread his earlier writing. These two items have the correct subject -- as written in the inventory.) She was the daughter of Don Jerónimo de Lezama, secretary of the Consejo de Guerra, and widow of the Galician councillor Don Joseph Pardo de Figueroa, a member of the Consejo de Castilla and Consejo de Guerra, whom she married in 1650 (Fayard 1982, p. 271). Pardo de Figueroa was nominated a member of the Consejo de Castilla directly by royal decree in 1659 (Fayard 1982, p. 86, no. 6, p. 112) and, given the favor shown him by the king and the high state office he occupied, it is not surprising that his loyalty should be expressed by a portrait of Philip IV, whose quality was such that it was attributed to Velázquez himself (no. 39). The inventoried paintings (ff. 1173-1175v) were appraised in the same order by the painter Juan de Vega on 4 October 1678 (ff. 1199-1203v), except those that were bequeathed in Lezama's testament. It was recognized that three pictures were copied from Titian prototypes, an Entombment of Christ (no. 7) and a pair representing the Ecce Homo and Mater Dolorosa (nos. 20, 21), all of which were among the most reproduced of Titian's religious paintings in Spain. The Entombment measured 168 x 126 cm. and was hung in a carved and gilded frame, as were the following five religious paintings in the valuation (nos. 8-12), suggesting that they had been hung as a relatively uniform set of images. A certain deliberate order appears to have informed other paintings in the document; for instance, a Dormition of Mary Magdalene (no. 13) was followed by three female saints of the same size (nos. 14-16) and a pair of paintings of SS. Peter and Paul (nos. 17-18). The inventory of the collection of Lezama and her husband perhaps suggests a certain sobriety to their taste. Although no mythological subjects were listed, there was a large painting of Cleopatra (no. 44). There were also still lifes and landscapes, and some of the latter expressed a link with the family's provincial origins. Two paintings represented the port town of Bilbao (no. 48), which Pardo de Figueroa and his wife must have known well, and another landscape that depicted hunting lands belonging to them in Vizcaya (no. 49) may also have evoked fond memories of visits and recreation. The copy of an imaginary landscape by Bassano (no. 25) was complemented by no less than three copies of paintings by the Spanish Bassano, Pedro Orrente (nos. 40, 41, 42). The latter copies, among others documented in collections after 1650, reflect the continuing popularity of Orrente's paintings in the second half of the seventeenth century. In all probability, the set of paintings of the Story of David by Juan de la Corte (no. 43) represented small figures in extensive architectural settings, which was also probably the format of the perspective by Viviano Codazzi (no. 6) in the collection.","Collectors Files:  Lezcama, Ana María de","input"

The majority of Zabalza's paintings were of religious subjects, including four Immaculate Conceptions (nos. 5, 19, 34, 43), and only a handful of secular subjects, including genre pictures (no. 2, 21, 22), seascapes (no. 4), and still lifes (nos. 23, 26). The fact that only two mythological subjects were listed (nos. 13, 42) would seem to confirm Zabalza's devout taste, although the painting of a bacchanal is likely to be the painting listed as a fable of the goddesses in the inventory and may well have depicted female nudes. This document identified a series of small panels by Albrecht Dürer (no. 1). There was a genre scene painted on copper by Pieter van Laer (no. 2), the Flemish artist working in Rome, as well as a Flemish picture on copper of Mary Magdalene (no. 57). The artist identified as Valdi, who painted a Descent from the Cross (no. 7) and a portrait (no. 18), may refer to either the Tuscan artist at the Spanish court, Angelo Nardi, or perhaps a garbled form of Van Dyck. The other dozen attributed paintings in the collection represented the major painters active in Madrid during Zabalza's life. A number of valuable works listed anonymously in the document may also have been painted by such artists. Clearly an important collector of contemporary paintings, Zabalza would also be a significant patron if we could determine that his works had been commissioned from the artists themselves. Among the older of the artists represented in the collection was Diego Velázquez himself, who was, it was believed, the author of Zabalza's portrait of Philip IV (no. 17), an image explained by Zabalza's royal appointment as silversmith to the king's chamber. Pedro Núñez del Valle (ca.1594-1654?) painted a Mystic Marriage of St. Catherine, which was listed first among the paintings inventoried on 29 December 1677 (Un lienzo del Desposorio de s.ta Cathalina con marco negro Moldura dorada de mano de Pedro Nuñez - y no tiene la Moldura dorada, f. 243). Of the four paintings of this subject listed anonymously in the valuation (nos. 14, 20, 32, 56), it is most likely to correspond to the version in a black frame valued at 250 reales (no. 20). The size of another version of the subject attributed to Mateo Cerezo (1637-1666) in the inventory corresponds with the painting valued at 3,600 reales in Smidt's valuation (no. 14). He evidently thought highly of this work, which could be the painting of almost exactly the same measurements signed and dated 1660 and now in the Prado, or a version of this (Pérez Sánchez 1986, p. 297, no. 132). The short-lived Mateo Cerezo was represented by two more paintings, a St. Michael (no. 6) and a modestly valued Immaculate Conception (no. 43); another short-lived painter of his generation, Juan Antonio de Frías y Escalante (1633-1669), was represented by two pictures (nos. 11, 12). There was an Entombment by Francisco Camilo (ca. 1615-1673) (no. 37), whose naturalism was remarked on in the inventory (otro lienzo del sepulcro de christo de cuerpo natural con marco negro de mano de camilo), as was another anonymous St. Jerome al natural. Camilo's painting was, perhaps, related to the painting now in the Museo de Bellas Artes, Valencia (Ibid., p. 294, no. 130). Although works of Francisco Rizi (1614-1685) are, perhaps, conspicuous by their absence, they may be among pictures listed anonymously in the documents. Three paintings, however, were by the hand of the royal painter Juan Carreño de Miranda; one was copied after Titian's Lucretia (no. 16), another was a Virgin and Child (no. 15), and the most valuable of all was an Immaculate Conception (no. 5), valued at 5,500 reales. The most highly valued painting in the entire collection, however, was Alonso Cano's Christ at the Column (no. 8), worth 6,600 reales. The value of this work, as with Carreño's Immaculate Conception, could not depend only upon such factors as the picture's size or the number of figures represented, but must also have reflected aesthetic criteria such as Cano's skill in depicting the male nude, as well as Smidt's own admiration for the works of his peers. Carreño's Immaculate Conception (no. 5), Cerezo's Mystic Marriage of St. Catherine (no. 14), and Cano's Christ at the Column (no. 8) were purchased at Zabalza's almoneda by Don Sebastian de Soria; the former two paintings sold for 2,700 reales and 1,700 reales, respectively, on 7 February 1678 (ff. 301v-302), and the latter painting by Cano sold on 9 February for 3,300 reales (f. 306). These sale prices are consistent with others in the auction, in which all of the paintings were sold for roughly half of their appraised values. Soria also purchased Escalante's St. Joseph and the Christ Child (no. 11) and Diego Estella bought Escalante's Flight into Egypt (no. 12) on 11 February. The five paintings by Cano, Carreño, Cerezo, and Escalante apparently entered the collection of Pedro de Vallejo (Doc. 98), but since Vallejo was not recorded as bidding at Zabalza's sale, he must have acquired the works almost immediately from Sebastián de Soria and Diego Estella, who may even have been his agents. Soria is also recorded buying a painting of a tavern scene, un quadro de una osteria, at the auction of Vallejo's paintings on 24 September 1678.","Collectors Files:  Zabalza, Luis de","input"

The picture collection was valued by the royal painter Don Francisco Rizi on 13 September 1678, after which some paintings were sold at an estate auction that opened on 15 September; the rest of the collection was inherited by Vallejo's widow and two daughters. Vallejo's 18 battle paintings (nos. 8, 14, 22) reflect a particular taste for such works, but he also owned seascapes (nos. 20, 24), perspectives (no. 23), flowerpieces (no. 7), garlands containing religious images (no. 9), and even a Flemish tavern scene (no. 10). The first five pictures are the only attributed paintings in Rizi's valuation of Vallejo's collection (nos. 1-5) and are, moreover, the most valuable pictures. They all appear to have come from the collection of the royal silversmith Luis de Zabalza, who had died at the end of 1677 (see Doc. 97). Thus Cano's Christ at the Column (no. 1) that is found at the head of Vallejo's valuation was also listed in the appraisal of Zabalza's collection (Doc. 97, no. 8), as was Vallejo's Immaculate Conception by Carreño (no. 2) (Doc. 97, no. 5), the two paintings by Escalante of the Flight into Egypt and St. Joseph with the Christ Child (nos. 3, 4) (Doc. 97, nos. 11, 12), and Mateo Cerezo's Mystic Marriage of St. Catherine (no. 5) (Doc. 97, no. 14). Comparing the valuations of the same pictures by Smidt and Rizi, the latter reduced the values of the paintings by Escalante and Cerezo by between 300 and 500 reales, and reduced the painting by Cano by 1,100 reales, while allowing the painting by his colleague Carreño to hold its original value. It is unclear, however, to what extent these changes may have been dictated by economic factors and currency fluctuations in the six months between the two appraisals.","Collectors Files:  Vallejo, Pedro de","input"

Francisco de MEdrano, presbítero, beginning in Madrid, 13 December 1689. Photocopy of paintings inventoried, ff. 558v-578v.'","The title of Conde de Peñaranda de Bracamonte was conceded to Don Alonso de Bracamonte y Guzmán (Santiago) on 31 January 1602 (According to Atienza, 1959, p. 926). The fourth conde, Don Gregorio de Bracamonte, whose inventory is presented here, achieved Grandeza in 1676. The family title is today linked with that of the duchies of Osuna and Frías, but during the 1600s the Bracamonte family was closely allied by marriage and personal relationships with the Olivares-Carpio faction at court in Madrid as well as with the powerful Spinola and Colonna families. The third conde, Don Gaspar de Bracamonte y Guzmán, was a testamentario of the will of the Marqués de Leganés in 1655 and is found linked with Don Luis de Haro in a number of other documents of the period. Carducho had already cited the young Gaspar de Bracamonte as a collector and friend of the arts in 1633 (Carducho 1633, f. 159 -- reprinted in Sánchez Canton, Fuentes, vol. 2, p. 113). The Peñaranda collections were presumably augmented by Don Gaspar's assignment to the Viceroyalty of Naples, 1658-1664. As we have seen (Introduction), Don Gaspar, before leaving Italy, bought 39 pictures from the collection of the Marchese Giovanni Francesco Serra di Cassano, a Genoese general who had fought for Spain. In typical Olivares-Carpio fashion, the pictures were bought to be given to the king, including for use at the Escorial. It is interesting to compare the remarkably high quality of the Serra pictures (most of which are now in the Prado) to the works in the Peñaranda personal collection documented here. One must also recall the Conde de Peñaranda's documented patronage of Andrea Vaccaro and Luca Giordano (Prota Giurleo 1960, p. 59, also cites the acquisition of works of art in Naples by Peñaranda; cf. Pérez Sánchez 1965, pp. 67f. Archivo de Palacio, Madrid, Sección Expedientes Personales (empleados), caja 140, sections 37-42; the content of these documents on the Bracamonte family is summarized in Burke 1984, vol. 2, Documents 2.44a-f). Harold Wethey cited a supposed eyewitness account (relayed by the historian Abate Vincenzo D'Onofrio) to the effect that Peñaranda departed Naples with 1500 colli grandiosi (Abate Vincenzo D'Onofrio, writing under the pseudonym of Innocenzo Fuidoro, Giornale di Napoli -- first published Naples 1934; see Wethey 1967, p. 681. Possibly there was some confusion with Don Gaspar de Guzmán, 7th Marqués del Carpio, who was Viceroy of Naples in the 1680s - see Doc. 114). All of this suggests that the collection may have been dispersed before the 1689 inventory or only partially represented therein. The inventory of D. Gregorio Genaro de Bracamonte y Guzman, 4th Conde de Peñaranda, who died 8 December 1689, was drawn up by his widow, Doña Agustina Spinola Colonna, Condesa de Peñaranda, and by Don Francisco de Medrano, presbítero, beginning in Madrid, 13 December 1689, with the paintings inventoried on 29 January 1690 (ff. 558v-578v).","Collectors Files:  Peñaranda, Gregorio Genaro de Bracamonte y Guzmán, Conde de","input"

Photocopy of valuation of paintings at ff. 122-131v.'","The postmortem inventory of Andrés de Villarán (d. 25 March 1683), a knight of the Order of Santiago and member of the council of the royal treasury (Consejo y Contaduria Mayor de Hacienda), was drawn up by his executors, the licenciado Don Lucas Rebollo, mayordomo of the convent of the Magdalena at Alcalá de Henares, and Don Pedro Fernández de Pradilla, contador (royal accountant), in Madrid beginning on 28 March 1683. The executors nominated the painter Antonio Palomino to value Villarán's collection of paintings, which he undertook on 1 May 1683. Villarán's collection contained five paintings associated with Anthony van Dyck (nos. 7, 13, 19, 28, 31), but Palomino considered only one -- an Incredulity of St. Thomas (no. 7) -- an original. However, a copy of the Mystic Marriage of St. Catherine (no. 28) was said to be very well made and was valued at the same amount as the original. The collection contained a Virgin of the Almudena by the royal painter Juan Carreño de Miranda (no. 16). Carreño was also named as the author of a St. Onofre copied after Jusepe Ribera (no. 6), which, judging from their respective valuations, Palomino considered a much better painting than another anonymous copy of a St. Francis (no. 26) after Ribera. In the case of Villarán's three compositions by Pedro de Orrente (nos. 10, 17, 23), however, one of the copies, a Triumph of David (no. 10), was considered more valuable than an original Holy Family by the same artist (no. 23). This may not have been based simply on its quality, but may also reflect the number of figures it contained. Like many of his peers, Villarán also owned a copy after the work of Titian (no. 15) and a Correggio that was also most likely a copy, being valued at only 150 reales (no. 1). Although Villarán's collection contained relatively few landscape paintings, two were distinctive enough to be listed as copies after Benito Manuel Agüero (no. 5), and there was a Flemish work (no. 56). He seems to have enjoyed paintings of the sea, however, and the valuation listed a port scene by Juan de Toledo (no. 57), two seascapes by an unidentified Italian(?) painter (no. 2), as well as several anonymous items. Villarán appears to have had a particular taste for the works of Antonio de Pereda, owning two paintings of saints by him (nos. 8, 29) and two religious histories of the Imprisonment of St. Peter (no. 32) and Moses and the Plague of Serpents (no. 40). However, the most highly valued picture by Pereda was a Vanitas still life (no. 44), called Gerolifico del desengaño and clearly an important example of a genre that Pereda made his own. While the painting contained the traditional symbols of death, a skull and clock, an ironic twist was given to the subject by the inclusion of artists' materials, a palette, brushes, and papers (Jordan and Cherry 1995, pp. 21-24, 79-84). In Palomino's valuation, this painting was worth more than a flowerpiece and fruit still life by the Flemish specialist Alexander Adriensen (nos. 41, 42) and another painting whose description suggests it may have been a trompe l'oeil (no. 34).","Collectors Files:  Villarán, Andrés de","input"

Photocopy (ii) of paintings at ff. 319-335.'","The postmortem inventory of Don Juan de Echauz (d. 7 June 1687), a knight of Santiago, was drawn up by his widow Elena María de Benavente, with the paintings collection inventoried on 26 June 1687 (ff. 198-205v) and valued between 21 and 22 August by the painter Jerónimo Ezquerras (ff. 318-336). The collection included a full-length portrait of the collector himself as a young man (no. 45), along with portraits of Charles II as a child (no. 57) and king (no. 13), as well as a pair of images of Philip IV and Queen Isabella of Borbon (no. 42, and probably no. 55), and other members of the royal family. One of the more valuable paintings in the appraisal of Echauz's collection was Christ at the Column by Bartolomé de Cárdenas (no. 17). In the early part of the century, this artist had been painter to the Duque de Lerma and was made painter to the city of Valladolid in 1622, but had died more than fifty years before the inventory. The fact that his name was remembered at all suggests that the painting was prominently signed or had been a particular favorite of its owner for devotional or aesthetic reasons. The only other attributed works included a series of Flemish battles by Jan Snellinck I (no. 1), which were complemented by other battle paintings in the collection (nos. 2, 3, 11), and whose military theme was perhaps considered appropriate for a collector who was also a knight of the military Order of Santiago. There were two copies of Titian's famous Ecce Homo and Mater Dolorosa (no. 28) from the Spanish royal collection, and a number of perspectives (no. 6), a landscape with ruins (no. 60), and four still lifes (bodegones) (no. 58), painted in Italy. The only clearly identified mythological narrative in the appraisal was a painting of Venus and Adonis, an ordinario copy after Rubens (no. 46), probably derived from the prototype which is today in New York (Metropolitan Museum).","Collectors Files:  Echauz, Juan de","input"

(Valuation of estate ff. 19-50v, from 7/8/1639.)'","An inventory of the estate of Sebastián Díaz de Ontiveros and his wife Ana María Nuñez de Cos began on 7 June 1639, the date of her death. The extensive picture collection was appraised on 14 August by the painter Diego Rodríguez. Although the document does not specify the profession of Díaz de Ontiveros, the presence of portraits of Spanish royals in the collection suggests that he was in royal service, as was his son, Don Bernabé Díaz de Cos, a contador (royal accountant). There were full-length and half-length portraits of Philip IV and Queen Isabella (nos. 35, 36), as well as one of prince Baltasar Carlos (no. 37), and two pairs of portraits of Díaz de Ontiveros and his wife (nos. 31, 32). Interestingly, two of the latter portraits (no. 32) and another of a relative (no. 33) were said to be painted from nature. Díaz de Ontiveros himself died on 24 June 1641, and his inventory was drawn up by his son and heir, with the paintings collection appraised by the painter Matias Pastor on 1-2 September 1641 (AHPM, Prot. 6.212, ff. 632-636). Only a few paintings were sold at the public auction of September 1641; the majority of paintings were auctioned in an estate sale of May 1646 (AHPM, Prot. 4.785, ff. 736-739.) The appraisal of Díaz de Ontiveros' paintings in 1639 began with religious subjects, which were perhaps considered to be the most important images in the collection and many of which were from his oratory (as specified in his inventory of June-July 1641). A copy after a Correggio Virgin and Child (no. 21) had been painted by Antonio Ricci, a mediocre artist who nevertheless had a livelihood copying paintings by sixteenth-century masters. However, the collection included a broad range of subject matter, which indicates a taste for the diverse sorts of pleasure afforded by the art of painting. At the other end of the scale to his religious pictures, Díaz de Ontiveros also owned a small comic painting of a drunkard (no. 66). There were 15 still-life paintings, four of which were by Juan van der Hamen (no. 38), the best still-life painter of the 1620s. Although the document specified that these were originals in order to distinguish them from the studio variants and copies common on the Madrid market, they were, nevertheless, listed as overwindows in the inventory of 1641. Among the landscape paintings were works by Paul Bril (no. 41), and two contemporary Spanish artists who specialized in landscapes for private collectors at court: Francisco Collantes (no. 56) and Juan de la Corte (no. 67). Two of the landscapes depicted mythological subjects (nos. 68), and the collection included figure paintings of the Abduction of Proserpina (no. 46), Venus and Cupid, Cupid, Cupid chastised by Pallas Athena, and Midas (the last four pictures all described in item no. 48), the last painting perhaps by Eugenio Caxés, whose name was garbled to jaques in the document. In the inventory of 1641, these mythologies, along with a mix of religious images, seascapes, landscapes, sibyls, and still lifes, were listed in Díaz de Ontiveros' study (dentro del escritorio). His Abduction of Ganymede (no. 51) was a copy after the painting by Correggio that had been in the famous collection of Antonio Pérez, which was copied for the Spanish royal collection by Eugenio Caxés in 1604, and is now in Vienna (Angulo and Pérez Sánchez 1969, p. 252, no. 190). In the appraisal of Díaz de Ontiveros' collection in 1641 the painting of Cupid making his bow (no. 54) was also listed as a copy after another Correggio mythology, although this is reminiscent of a painting by Parmigianino also now in Vienna. These two copies made up part of the decoration inventoried in 1641 of his urban recreational casa jardin on the outskirts of the capital, along with other fables, the Burning of Troy (no. 45; complemented in the collection by a less common image of the story of Aeneas and Troy, no. 52), paintings of the Months, landscapes (including two views of the environs of Madrid) and still lifes. Díaz de Ontiveros' painting of the pícaro of Rome removing a thorn (no. 53) was a representation of the famous classical bronze of the Boy Removing a Thorn from his Foot, the Spinario, which was long considered to represent a shepherd boy (Haskell and Penny, Taste and the Antique, 1981, cat. 78). This painting was also inventoried in 1641 hanging in his casa jardin (un quadro...de una estatua de rroma de Un hombre que se saca Una astilla del pie). It was bought from his estate by Don Agustín Daza (4 May 1646), along with a large number of other pictures, and was inventoried in the latter's collection on his death in 1678 (AHPM, Prot. 8.181, unfoliated; Getty Provenance Index No. E-216). This was one of the most famous antiques visible in Rome and copies in sculpture existed in Spain, one example presiding over a fountain at Aranjuez since the sixteenth century. More than anything, it was probably the naturalism of this classical genre subject which was so admired; other painted examples listed in inventories of picture collections of the period testify to its popularity among connoisseurs. A copy was listed in the collection of the royal escribano Juan González Trujeque in 1643 (AHPM, Prot. 6.227, ff. 660-663v; Getty Provenance Index No. E-55) and in the collection of Don Fernando de Borja in 1666 (Doc. 78, no. 138).","Collectors Files:  Díaz de Ontiveros, Sebastián","input"

Juan de Matute, Canon of Granada Cathedral, December 1628 (d. 8 January 1629).  ii)Photocopy of inventory of Matute's estate in Granada, drawn up by the deceased 22 December 1628, ff. 11-16v.'","Doctor Juan de Matute, canon of Granada cathedral, died on 8 January 1629, while on business in Madrid. When he fell ill at the end of December 1628, he drew up a last will and testament and included in the document a record (memoria) of a few possessions in Madrid (ff. 9-10v, 11 December) and, more importantly, an inventory of his estate in Granada (ff. 11-16v, 22 December 1628) written in his own hand. The remarkable and vivid holograph inventory included Matute's collection of pictures (ff. 13-14v), some of which were housed in Granada (nos. 1-23, 30-33) and others outside the city at Pulianas (nos. 24-29). A series of paintings of hermits were divided between the two properties (no. 8). Matute's paintings are listed in considerable detail in the document, and their owner sometimes mentions their history and value, even occasionally freely expressing his personal opinions and enthusiasm about their quality. The works are qualified as soberana (no. 2), extraordinaria (nos. 6,7), muy alta (no. 14), and valiente (nos. 15, 16). Matute's paintings by Andrea del Sarto (nos. 15, 19), as well as copies after Sarto (nos. 11, 12) suggest that he had connections with Florence. It is clear from Matute's comments, however, that he had lived in Rome, probably attached to the papal court, where he had acquired some of his pictures. Indeed, his own portrait (no. 22), painted by Ottavio Leoni and depicting Matute holding a document addressed to the Pope, was a painting that he himself qualified as a very great work. A large Immaculate Conception (no. 5) which Matute had made into an altarpiece had been copied from a smaller prototype in Rome. A set of 12 paintings of Thebaid hermits in beautiful landscapes (no. 8) had been bought in Rome, where the canvases alone had cost 10 ducats; and seven paintings of the Creation (no. 23) had cost 12 ducats each in Rome. Two works, St. Francis Receiving the Stigmata and St. Anthony of 'Paula' were painted by the currently unidentified painter Casto foix, who is called a great Flemish painter of Rome (nos. 9-10). Matute also reveals his knowledge of at least one important Roman picture collection in specifying that his copy of St. John the Baptist with a Lamb (no. 13) was from the famous painting owned by the Mattei family. (Given the controversy surrounding the identity of the figure in Caravaggio's painting now in the Capitoline Museum, Rome, it is worth noting that Matute believed it depicted St. John the Baptist.) He owned another large painting of his name saint, St. John the Baptist, in which the figure was said to be nude in the desert, embracing a lamb without horns (no. 17). It is intriguing to speculate on the possibility of a connection between Matute's copy of Caravaggio's St. John and Caravaggesque images of St. John the Baptist attributed to Juan Bautista del Mayno, an artist by whom he owned two works (nos. 2 and 14) (Angulo Iñiguez and Pérez Sánchez 1969, p. 317, nos. 36, 37). The only Spanish artist identified in Matute's collection is Juan Bautista del Mayno (1578-1641), called Juan Bautista Pastrana after Pastrana, his town of birth (no. 14). Matute noted that Mayno was a Dominican monk--a fact of considerable interest to a collector who himself had taken religious orders -- and also that he was Philip IV's painting master. The Mary Magdalene in the Desert by his hand, which Matute qualified as very high painting, (no. 14) probably represented the figure in a landscape and may have been similar in type to his Penitent Magdalene in the Prado (Iñiguez and Pérez Sánchez 1969, p. 317, no. 39) or his signed St. John the Baptist in the Wilderness (p. 317, no. 36). Clearly very proud of his collection, Matute was not shy about recording the costs, value, and desirability of some of the paintings, perhaps with a degree of hyperbole. Thus, a small copper of the Immaculate Conception in an ebony frame and covered by a coloured taffeta curtain was said to be worth over 100 escudos (no. 4). Matute made the point that his painting of Belshazzar's Feast, worth more than 500 ducats, had been copied twice and that the owners of these copies, Don Juan de la Rea and Don Luis de Villaguituire, valued them at more than 1,000 ducats each (no. 6). A copy of his Agony in the Garden by Orazio Borgianni (no. 16) was given to the Conde de Lemos, who also valued it at 1,000 ducats. While these examples demonstrate the high regard in which good copies were held by collectors, the fact that Matute had been offered as much as 200 ducats for his Christ and the Virgin in half-length by Titian (no. 3) is adduced in the document almost as a proof of its authenticity as an original work.","Collectors Files:  Matute, Juan de, Doctor","input"

Inventory, ff. 405-440, dated Madrid 11 May 1655, & drawn up by Villaroel himself.  Photocopy of paintings, ff. 405-406.'","In a codicil to his will drawn up in Madrid on 11 May 1655, the silversmith Andrés de Villarroel identified himself by royal titles, as platero de cámara del Rey and tasador de sus reales joyas. Rather than referring to a salaried court position, these distinctions probably derived from professional services to the Crown rendered during Villarroel's career, akin to the English By appointment to Her Majesty, and must have been the source of considerable pride and prestige among the artisan community in the capital. Villaroel was a witness of the valuation of the collection of Gaspar de Ledesma Meriño (Doc. 4), at whose sale he bought pictures, and may have been connected with the latter's son, also called Gaspar de Ledesma Meriño and also a silversmith. Villarroel appended to his codicil an inventory and appraisal of his goods, which recorded a small picture collection of some 43 paintings whose values were set by the owner himself, probably in relation to the prices he originally paid for the works (de los precios mas ajustados y moderados que yo alcanço sin esajeracion alguna). He owned a Virgin and Child based on a prototype by Titian (no. 11) whose value, 30 ducats, probably reflects its high quality. While Villarroel's collection was not large by the standards of others included in this volume, he seems to have enjoyed the painting of the court painter Pedro Núñez del Valle (ca. 1590/94-ca. 1654), 14 of whose works he owned. Villarroel identified all of these paintings as originals by Núñez del Valle, which could suggest that he had himself ordered them directly from the artist. They included examples from the full range of his painting, comprising religious subjects, mythological subjects in landscape settings, a pair of allegories of love, and landscape paintings, including a view of Madrid and another of Rome. Pedro Núñez had lived and worked in Rome, where he is documented in 1613, and it is conceivable that he may have begun painting figure subjects in landscape settings in the manner of northern artists working there. A landscape with ruins by Paul Bril? (no. 4) confirms Villarroel's taste for such paintings, although the document also lists one by Pedro Orrente (no. 5), who worked in the style of the Bassani. Villarroel owned six fruit still lifes by Juan van der Hamen (1596-1631), the artist who had dominated the genre at court during the 1620s. These were also designated as originals, which therefore distinguished them from the workshop versions and copies of his works that satisfied the demand from less discerning collectors than Villarroel. While two depicted baskets of fruit (no. 9), and were, uncharacteristically, framed in white frames, three other paintings represented fruit on small silver plates, a subject that would have been of considerable appeal to a collector of Villarroel's profession.","Collectors Files:  Villarroel, Andrés de","input"

On 26 February 1628, Alviz drew up an appraisal of his capital assets brought to his marriage to Manuela Cortés, widow of the regidor of Valladolid Andrés Alonso de Usategui (AHPM, Prot. 5.091, ff. 50-58). In this document, three of the paintings in Alviz's collection were attributed to the court painter Eugenio Caxés (f. 56, Yten tres quadros de pintura de payses de una tercia de largo y una quarta de ancho de las ystorias de abraan de la lucha de jacob con el angel y otro de media bara de alto y una tercia de ancho pintado a lo alto del carro de elias de mano de eugenio Cajesi, valued at 8 ducats each). Caxés also valued the collection on 23 August 1628 on the premature death of Manuela Cortés, a document in which none of the works were attributed (ff. 30-33v). The entire picture collection was considered Alviz's property. On Alviz's own death in August 1639, his widow, Catalina de la Cámara, drew up the postmortem inventory of the estate and had the picture collection appraised by the painter Francisco Mexía on 12 September 1639 (AHPM, Prot. 5.979, ff. 27v-29v). Many of the pictures that were attributed in the inventory were not copied into Mexía's appraisal, and these appear in brackets in the transcription below. In the estate sale of Alviz's goods, paintings were bought by a number of collectors of note (AHPM, Prot. 5.979, ff. 30-35v, 12 September 1639). Don Pedro de Velasco, for instance, bought works by Caxés, Don Juan del Hierro bought the Caxés Immaculate Conception, and Don Francisco Gutiérrez bought many works, including pictures by Orrente, Caxés, and Juan de la Corte. In the 1639 documents, attributions of paintings were all to Spanish painters practicing in the capital, with whom Alviz could have had personal contact. Although Alviz's picture collection was not large, numbering only 52 paintings, his importance as a collector of paintings by contemporary artists merited him a mention among the outstanding connoisseurs at court in Carducho's Diálogos de la pintura (Carducho ed. 1979, p. 425).  By 1639, Alviz boasted an Immaculate Conception (no. 1) and nine religious narrative paintings by Eugenio Caxés (nos. 8, 17bis, 18, 19, 20, 21, 26), one of which was not listed in the appraisal, as well as works by Caxés' colleague at court, Vicencio Carducho (nos. 2, 3, 4). Alviz owned paintings of Old Testament subjects by Pedro de Orrente (nos. 5 and 17) -- the latter seemingly commissioned by Alviz according to the accompanying annotation. The popular painter of scenes with small figures, Juan de la Corte was represented in the collection by four paintings (nos. 9, 16, 23, 28). There was a figure subject of Moses by Francisco de Collantes (no. 24), which may have been paired with a story of Jonah by Juan de la Corte (no. 23). Three subject paintings were listed by Cristóbal de Acevedo (no. 6), an artist who was a popular painter of landscapes (Díaz del Valle, ed. 1933, p. 365). A landscape by Juan de la Corte (no. 28) depicted the Conversion of St. Paul, and two landscapes with figure subjects by Collantes appear to have hung near a picture by Andrés de Vargas (no. 27). Alviz acquired most of his still-life paintings after 1628, since in the inventories of this year only two such paintings were listed anonymously. One was a painting of some fruit and the other a breakfast piece, Un almuerco de tocino y algunas frutas, worth 100 reales, and both pictures could be subsumed under the descriptions in the later inventory. In 1639, Alviz's collection listed eight still-life paintings, seven by Juan van der Hamen. These works could have been acquired directly from the artist in the last three years of his life or bought on the open market. Three pictures were worth 100 reales each, two representing a cardoon and hanging grapes (no. 12) and another larger picture glasses, clay vessels, and fruit (no. 13). Four other smaller pictures depicted still lifes of fruit (nos. 11, 15). It was natural that Alviz should have collected still lifes by Van der Hamen, since he was not only the best and most famous still-life painter in Madrid in the 1620s, but also an important member of the Carducho circle at court. One other still-life painting with radishes and fruit was said to be by the Dominican (no. 14), which possibly refers to Juan Bautista Mayno, an ordained member of the Dominican order. An Italian artist of this name was documented in Madrid in 1608 (See Agulló Cobo 1981, p. 63), but perhaps the artist most likely to have been referred to here was a Flemish still-life painter called Allaert who was also a Dominican father, and by whom ten bird still lifes were listed in the collection of the Conde de Molina in 1675 (Doc. 93, nos. 8, 9, 14, 15, 93, 102).","Collectors Files:  Alviz, Jerónimo de","input"

Agulló y Cobo El Monasterio de San Plácido y su fundador, el madrileño don Jerónimo de Villanueva, Protonotario de Aragón, Villa de Madrid, XIII, no.45-46 (1975) p.60.","The postmortem inventory of Jerónimo de Villanueva (For Villanueva see J.H. Elliott and José F. de la Peña, Memoriales y cartas del Conde Duque de Olivares, Madrid, 1978, I, p. 80, no. 44; J.H. Elliott, The Count-Duke of Olivares, New Haven and London, 1986, pp. 260-261, 316-317, 421-423) (Madrid 1594-Zaragoza 1653), knight of the Order of Calatrava and comendador of Santibañez, was drawn up by his nephew, Don Gerónimo de Villanueva, Knight of Alcántara. The inventory of Villanueva's moveable goods (bienes muebles) was taken in his house in Madrid on the calle de la Madera, and began with his collection of paintings inventoried between 26 and 27 August 1653. Thanks to his father, Agustín de Villanueva (Doc. 6), Villanueva began his court career in minor posts in the secretariats of Aragón and Mallorca; he inherited his post of Protonotario de la Corona de Aragón on the death of his father. Recruited into the regime of the Conde-Duque de Olivares and knighted in 1626, Villanueva became his secretary as well as one of his closest confidants and most loyal ministers. Rapidly rising at court, he was the most powerful man of the regime after the válido himself: Secretario del Despacho between 1627-43, in direct contact with both the king and Olivares, and from 1630-43 the first Secretario de Estado para España, a post suppressed in 1643. On Olivares's disgrace in 1643 Villanueva fell from power and was imprisoned in 1644 for two years. News of his arrest was said to have precipitated Olivares' death. Villanueva retired to Zaragoza in August 1647, where he died on 21 July 1653. His last will and testament was drawn up in Zaragoza on 22 July (AHPM, Prot. 6.047, ff. 1-8). His body was returned to Madrid and buried in the convent of San Plácido. Villanueva founded the Benedictine convent of La Encarnación Benita de San Plácido in Madrid in 1623, which nuns entered in May 1624. Scandal surrounded the convent almost from the time of its foundation. The prioress, Teresa Valle de la Cerda, had been betrothed to Villanueva, and a love affair between them was widely suspected. Legend has it that Olivares and Villanueva facilitated Philip IV's affair with a nun of the convent, even perfuming the cell in which they made love. San Plácido was certainly the focus of investigations into illicit forms of heterodoxical worship in 1628, although Villanueva's power at court meant that no action was taken against him. The Inquisitorial accusations against Villanueva in the process of 1644 included his having a pact with the devil and having had him painted in a certain form in his house (Agulló Cobo 1975, p. 66). In expiation of his sins, he may have commissioned Velázquez's Crucifixion (Madrid, Museo del Prado) for the convent around 1632 (Brown 1986, p. 161). He also spent 66,000 reales on appointing the convent, including paintings, and he put some of his own paintings at the disposal of the nuns. (See M. Agulló Cobo, El monasterio de San Plácido y su fundador, el madrileño don Jerónimo de Villanueva, Protonotario de Aragón, Villa de Madrid, XIII, nos. 45-46, 1975, pp. 59-68; XIII, no. 47, 1975, pp. 37-50.) Villanueva also had Rubens make a sketch for the high altar while he was in Madrid in 1628-29 (Brown 1986, p. 161). Villanueva was most conspicuous in the cultural life of the court through his enthusiastic participation in the building of the Buen Retiro palace. In his capacity as keeper of the king's secret expense account, he was intimately involved with financing its construction and decoration; his interest in the progress and decoration of the palace was such that he could frequently be found wandering around the building at midnight or dawn (Brown and Elliott 1986, p. 98). Possessing great private wealth, he also contributed money and other gifts from his own pocket and was an assiduous patron of plays and entertainments at the new palace (Ibid., pp. 68, 98, 103, 203, 205). He seems to have been personally interested in the decoration of the Salón de los Reinos, which was said to be the result of his care... desire ... prudence... [and] hard work. He added his personal touch to the ensemble with 12 silver lions rampant bearing the arms of Aragón, which cost no less than 24,000 ducats. On Villanueva's fall with Olivares in 1643, these were melted down for the war effort (Ibid., pp. 110-111). Some of Villanueva's 150 paintings were inherited from his father's collection. The inventory of 1653 listed Agustín de Villanueva's still-life painting (no. 65) and genre painting of the fruitseller (no. 69). While no new genre pictures had been added to the collection, there were more still lifes and flower paintings, which testifies to the great popularity of these genres at court from 1620. Villanueva also bought paintings at the estate auction of the Duc d'Aarschot on 2 October 1641: a Resurrection of Christ and a Magdalene Washing Christ's Feet in the House of Simon, a scene from classical history of Mucius Scaevola, and two still lifes (AHPM Prot. 5.993, ff. 1265-1265v). It is likely that these pictures were all Flemish works, since they were listed among the paintings sent from Flanders that arrived after Aarschot's death (see Doc. 30).  Although Villanueva's paintings are anonymous in the inventory of 1653, the subject matter of some of them parallels the decoration of the Buen Retiro's Salón de los Reinos and perhaps reflects his personal involvement in this effort. Eight landscapes with subjects from the story of Hercules (no. 7) are reminiscent of Francisco de Zurbarán's Labors of Hercules for the Salón (Madrid, Museo del Prado). In a 1663 inventory of goods from the estate of Martina Ferrer de Valenzuela (d. 1657) and Villanueva's namesake, nephew, and executor, Don Jerónimo de Villanueva, Marqués de Villalba and Protonotario de Aragón, these paintings headed the list of pictures, where they were described as eight landscapes of the labors of Hercules and Dejaneira, (ochos Paises de las fuerças de ercules y ejanira [sic], AHPM, Prot. 9.805, f. 166). The only attributed pictures in this later inventory were two portraits of the Duques of Florence by Tintoretto. Villanueva also owned a portrait series that appears to have included versions or copies of Velázquez's royal equestrian portraits of Philip III, Queen Margarita, Philip IV, Queen Isabella, and their son Prince Baltasar Carlos which presided over the Salón de los Reinos (all now in the Museo del Prado). There were two equestrian portraits of Philip IV and Queen Isabella that measured some 106 x 126 cm. (no. 45), and an equestrian portrait of Prince Baltasar Carlos (no. 9) of the same size. There was also a larger portrait of this prince (no. 46), which measured some 168 x 196 cm. Two slightly larger equestrian portraits of Philip III and Queen Margarita (no. 85) measured some 168 x 210 cm. Another equestrian portrait of the same size represented the Infante-Cardinal Don Ferdinand (no. 86). Two slightly smaller portraits of Philip IV and Queen Isabella might also have been equestrian portraits (nos. 87). There was a smaller portrait of the Conde-Duque de Olivares on a horse (no. 89). The size of this picture, some 106 x 126 cm., suggests that Villanueva's painting was similar to Juan Bautista del Mazo's Equestrian Portrait of the Conde-Duque de Olivares (102 x 125 cm.) in the Metropolitan Museum, New York. This portrait, which is a version of Velázquez's equestrian portrait of Olivares in the Prado Museum, was cited in the collection of the Marqués de Eliche in 1651. It is entirely fitting that Villanueva's collection should have contained a portrait of the patron with whom his own destiny was inextricably bound.","Collectors Files:  Villanueva, Jerónimo de","input"

Therefore an inventory of the oratory was drawn up by him and entailed to the estate. The inventory of the nine images from the oratory was headed by the two most important paintings by Luis de Morales (nos. 1, 2), and also included three pictures painted in Rome (nos. 4, 6, and 9). An Ascension of Christ (no. 3) was embroidered, and matched the subject of one of the Roman paintings (no. 6). However, the most remarkable and unusual feature of this inventory is the detailed description of the two paintings by Morales of the Ecce Homo and Christ Carrying the Cross. Morales' highly finished and detailed images of Christ were the focus for meditations on the Passion during private devotion. It seems that here too the notary has been stimulated by the visual intensity of these images to provide an extremely detailed record, one which is sensitive to the pathos of the images but which retains all the objectivity of a legal document. He was not as attentive to the other paintings in the collection. The description of the frames of the paintings by Morales, and the inscriptions on the frame of the Christ Carrying the Cross, also provide important near-contemporary evidence for the ways in which such works were presented.","Collectors Files:  Leguizamón, Isabel de","input"

Jerónimo de Villanueva, del Consejo de SM, Protonotario de los Reinos de Aragon, beginning 16 December 1620.  Photocopy of paintings, ff. 746-753.' (actually valuation)","During the reign of Philip III, Agustín de Villanueva had risen from his position of royal secretary to become Protonotario de los Reinos de Aragón and a royal councilor. His postmortem inventory, begun in Madrid on 16 December 1620, was drawn up by his son, D. Jerónimo de Villanueva, who inherited his father's offices. Villanueva's picture collection was appraised by Antonio Rizzi on 16 December 1620. It was made up of religious subjects, mostly of saints and devotional images of Christ and the Virgin. Many were small images painted on copper, panel, jasper, and illuminations on parchment, and there were a number of reliquaries, all of which were from Villanueva's oratory, as specified by an annotation following entry no. 53. Two small paintings on copper were considered precious enough to the owner to be covered with a curtain (nos. 15, 18). Villanueva's devout taste is reflected in the high percentage of religious subjects and his single mythology (no. 42). The portrait collection included those of Philip II and Prince Philip (III), and no less than three portraits of Cardinal Granvelle (1517-1586) (nos. 62, 70), which reflect Villanueva's admiration for this most trusted minister of Philip II. The collection also included portraits of Villanueva himself and his wife Ana Díaz de Villegas Polanco, the higher value of the painting of his wife perhaps owing to the greater amount of labor expended in painting an elaborate costume (nos. 60,61). Many of these pictures were listed in the earlier appraisal made of Villanueva's collection on the death of his wife by Antonio Rizi on 6 October 1610 (Agulló Cobo 1978, p. 135, citing AHPM, Prot. 1.826, ff. 853-858). The collection remained all but unchanged between 1610 and 1620, when it was inherited by his son Jerónimo, whose pictures were inventoried on his death in 1653 (Doc. 59).  Although none of Villanueva's paintings were attributed in any of the documents, one picture listed as a Portrait of the Marqués del Vasto was no doubt a copy of a famous Titian from the Spanish royal collection, taken to England by Charles, Prince of Wales, in 1623 and now in the Louvre (No. 40; Wethey, III, 1975, no. 1; Paris, Grand Palais, Le siècle de Titien, 1993, pp. 518-520, no. 164). In 1610, Villanueva's painting was listed as an Allegory of Chastity with a Portrait of Don Fernando de Gonzaga (La Castidad con una bola en la mano y el retrato de don Francisco de Gonzaga; Agulló Cobo 1978, p. 135). The lengthy description of the painting in the document of 1620 is consistent with this interpretation. The original, which enjoyed considerable fame even after it had left Madrid, is described by Carducho in 1633 (Carducho ed. 1979, pp. 433-434). A copy painted before 1614 was listed in the studio inventory of the royal painter Bartolomé González in 1627, in which the prototype was called by its familiar title of la bola de Ticiano (Cherry 1993, p. 8, no. 36). Like the collection of Gil Ramírez de Arellano (Doc. 3), Villanueva's collection included a single example of both a still life and a genre painting. The description of the still life, consisting of a partridge and other birds, a cardoon, and fruit (no. 64) calls to mind early Spanish paintings by Juan van der Hamen and Juan Sánchez Cotán, such as his Still Life with Game Fowl, Fruit and Cardoon signed and dated in 1602 in the Prado, Madrid. Villanueva acquired the painting after September 1610, as the work is not listed in the inventory drawn up on his wife's death. His more valuable genre painting was listed as un lienzo de un Bodegon grande al olio de frutas (AHPM, Prot. 1.826, f. 856v). Worth 400 reales in 1610, this had fallen a little in value a decade later, when it was described as a female fruitseller peeling a peach (no. 65). The contemporary folio pagination was assigned slightly out of order. Folio 750 (recto and verso) appears between f. 748v and f. 749. However, the actual order of the inventory has been adhered to in the following transcription.","Collectors Files:  Villanueva, Agustín de","input"

Her full name (González de Medina y Escalante) comes from the inventory.","Gil Ramírez de Arellano rose to prominence in public life during the reign of Philip III and the privanza of the Duque de Lerma. In 1602 he was one of the two lawyers (fiscales or procuradores generales) of the Council of Castile (Fayard 1982, pp. 25, 1550-156). This office normally led to an appointment to the Council itself, and probably a year later this occurred. Ramírez was protected by the Condes de Lemos and rose to become a member of the Consejo de Cámara in 1614 (Feros Carrasco 1986, pp. 136, 142). The inventory of Gil Ramirez de Arellano, which was begun in Madrid on 24 February 1618, was drawn up by his widow Catalina González de Medina. The paintings of the collection were inventoried in three separate categories: portraits (Cosas De rretrato, ff. 1293-1296), religious paintings from the oratory (Oratorio baxo, ff. 1299-1302), and pictures from the gallery (Cossas de la Galeria alta, ff. 1306v-1311v). The bracketed information appended to the transcription of some items comes from the subsequent valuation. Ramirez de Arellano's picture collection, which contained a broad range of subject paintings, was typical of its time in the numbers of series paintings displayed. Thus, there were sets of Roman emperors (no. 14), sibyls (no. 73), foreign ladies (no. 74), provincial costumes (no. 93), famous cities (no. 105), the Elements (no. 75), the Months (nos. 95, 97), the story of Noah (no. 60), and hermit saints (nos. 46, 98), totaling some 110 paintings. Some of these appear, however, to have been pictures of considerable quality; the Roman emperors were listed as quadros rricos (no. 14), one set of hermit saints (no. 46) described as rica pintura and twelve months qualified as rica la pintura (no. 97). Sixty fine landscape paintings also hung here (nos. 76, 91), along with five landscape friezes (no. 77) and twenty-eight works of lesser quality (nos. 78, 85, 100, 104, 108), mostly tempera paintings. One of the most interesting aspects of Ramírez de Arellano's taste is represented by the portrait collection that hung at the family seat (señorío) at Villaescusa de Haro, in the province of Cuenca. While he did not own a collection of portraits of famous men, by the time of his death he had assembled a gallery of dynastic family portraits to be handed on to the next generation. Such a display of family pride pointedly resembled those of great noble houses, and even the royal collection. The family's casa de los antepasados was the appropriate setting for these portraits, which were intended to impress on visitors and the family alike the distinction of the bloodline. The first room was hung with a series of 17 full-length labeled portraits, culminating in that of Gil Ramírez de Arellano himself, which traced his ancestry from the royal house of Navarre (no. 1). As well as manifesting the family's noble status, this display was also proof of their Old Christian origins, which was always a preoccupation of prominent Spanish public figures of the period. There were three other family portraits in this room, and a large coat of arms over the door (no. 3). A further room was hung with portraits of 11 archbishops who were also members of the family (no. 4); another with 14 portraits of the related family of the noble Condes de Aguilar (no. 5); and another with 16 portraits of illustrious relatives of Ramírez de Arellano (no. 6). Here were also the portraits of ancient Roman emperors; Gil Ramírez de Arellano may have sought to imply that his clan ultimately descended from ancient imperial lineage by adding his coat of arms to the center of a picture of the founding of Rome (no. 15 the entry misidentifying Aeneas leaving Troy for Rome) that headed one of the series of Roman emperors (no. 14). There were portraits of the Spanish House of Austria, although no portrait of the válido, the Duque de Lerma, was listed. Fifteen Rámirez de Arellano coats of arms hung along with royal portraits in his gallery (no. 71), clearly manifesting the extent to which the aspirations of the family were pinned to the Habsburg mast. Ramírez de Arellano appears to have had a taste for allegorical images (pensamientos or jeroglificos, as these sorts of images were called in the period). Such images would include his hieroglyph of Adam, Death, and Life (no. 42, see also no. 12), another of a crossbowman (no. 107), and perhaps four paintings of triumphs of Faith, Hope, Charity, and Prudence (no. 35, see also no. 30). There were also two curiosities: paintings of men and women whose eyes moved (no. 72). The only attributed paintings in this collection were by the famous painter Titian, the painter who was perhaps most admired by connoisseurs of the time, including the great collector the Duque de Lerma himself. One was a Pietà with a foreshortened Christ, a work which was very highly esteemed (de grandissima estima), and which hung in the oratory (no. 18). Another much esteemed painting in the oratory was a nocturnal Descent from the Cross attributed to Titian (no. 34). The subject matter of a further famous Titian nocturne was unspecified (no. 9). The most commonly used qualitative adjective in the document is that a picture is rica pintura or rich painting, most likely a metaphor that distinguished high-quality works in the collection. In a more literal sense, however, it may have denoted richness of color, of detail and figural incident, or even of the amount of gilding found on the frame, with the possible connotation of high value. At least two other pictures were described as famous painting (no. 45), and a genre piece of a woman in a kitchen as very great painting (no. 89). Ramírez de Arellano chose the gallery as the site to display his mythological subjects. A set of paintings represented Apollo and the Nine Muses (no. 88), a subject that was also represented in the contemporary collection of the Duque de Lerma. The paintings are also reminiscent of another set of paintings of Apollo and the Muses painted by Juan Bautista Mayno before 1613, mentioned in 1620 in the Toledan study of Francisco de Rojas y Guzmán (Angulo Iñiguez and Pérez Sánchez 1969, pp. 310-311). Some of Ramírez de Arellano's mythologies depicted female nude goddesses; there were seven fables of nude goddesses (no. 106) and a painting of a nude, sleeping Venus being discovered by a satyr (no. 82). Other paintings may also have included representations of female and male nudes, such as an old painting of the story of Adonis (no. 96), the Abduction of Ganymede (no. 84), a painting of nymphs (no. 83), and, of course, a large painting of Adam and Eve (no. 79). One unusual painting was described as a fable of mad love (with) an old man making love to a nude woman (no. 99), which perhaps represented folly in old age, which had some special significance for this collector. The gallery also displayed Ramírez de Arellano's sole example of the relatively novel genre of still life, a small painting of grapes, wine, bread, and a pie (no. 87), a small comic genre painting which is laughter painted (no. 90), and the above mentioned genre painting of a woman at a stall or in a kitchen (no. 89). The fact that he should own individual examples of still life and genre scenes is consistent with the collections of his noble peers, the most distinguished of which was that of the Duque de Lerma.","Collectors Files:  Ramírez de Arellano, Gil","input"

Partition of estate, ff. 319-538, Madrid 3 September 1637, with paintings inherited by the Marquesa (ff. 485v-504).' [see r.137 - mlg]","Don Antonio Portocarrero y Moscoso, Marqués de Villanueva del Fresno, Gentilhombre de cámara of the king and Infante-Cardinal, died in Germany on 29 July 1634, having been nominated ambassador of Philip IV and accompanying the Cardinal-Infante Don Ferdinand on his journey from Milan to Flanders to become Governor of the Netherlands. The inventory of his estate was drawn up by his widow, Francisca Fernández Portocarrero, Marquesa de Villanueva del Fresno y Barcarrota, Señora de Moguer, and begun in Madrid on 9 September 1634. The estate was partitioned between his widow and son, Don Juan Gaspar Domingo Portocarrero, and the final agreement notarized on 3 September 1637, in which his widow inherited the paintings collection (AHPM, Prot. 5.201, ff. 485v-504). Villanueva del Fresno's collection of paintings and the paintings of three cabinets was valued on 16 April 1635 by the painters Angelo Nardi and Francisco Bravo totaling some 26,500 reales. Paintings that belonged to the Marquesa de Villanueva's dowry included a Virgin and Child by one of the Carduchos (no. 103). Although no paintings by the obscure artist Francisco Gómez are known today, paintings by him of the king and queen of France were listed among a set of 11 full-length portraits of the House of Austria in Villanueva del Fresno's inventory. One of the paintings of a garden fountain attributed to Juan de la Corte in the valuation (nos. 36, 40) was said in the inventory to be painted by Francisco Gómez. As testimony to the marques' interest in art, Carducho in his Diálogos de la pintura of 1633, numbered him among the distinguished collectors of painting at court (Carducho ed. 1979, pp. 423-424). In the next year Jerónimo de Villanueva's secret expense account for the purchase of art for the Buen Retiro palace in 1634 listed a series of 14 paintings of the Plagues of Egypt, possibly by Pedro de Orrente, acquired from Villanueva del Fresno's collection (Brown and Elliott 1986, p. 123). Villanueva del Fresno's collection comprised a wide range of subjects, including a painting of Lucretia (no. 5) which may have represented a nude or semi-nude female figure, and  another picture of a woman bathing in a river (no. 106), probably the picture said in the inventory to depict a nude woman tying up her hair. An unusual subject that seems to appear only in the inventory represented a dream of a poet (f. 13, otra pintura grande de un sueño de un pueta [sic] en un lago). The majority of the pictures were listed anonymously in both inventory and valuation. However, the collection included copies after paintings by the time-honored Italian masters: Raphael's Transfiguration (no. 54) and three mythological subjects after Correggio (no. 52), Titian (no. 60). The only attributed modern Italian picture in Villanueva del Fresno's documents was a Flight into Egypt by the Venetian Caravaggesque artist Carlo Saraceni (no. 9). Taste for Saraceni's works may well have been stimulated by the importation of his four major paintings for the sacristy of Toledo Cathedral by Cardinal Sandoval ca.1613-14 (Pérez Sánchez, Caravaggio y el naturalismo español, Seville, 1973, nos. 31-33). Villanueva del Fresno's collection did include Toledan paintings: a head sketched in by Blas del Prado (no. 82) and paintings by El Greco of a Crucifixion (no. 56), a St. Peter (no. 55), and a Franciscan monk (no. 59), the last attributed in the inventory only. Villanueva del Fresno's inventory in fact listed three other pictures with attributions to contemporary artists. In the inventory, El Greco's Franciscan monk was immediately preceded by a half-length painting of St. Peter by Jusepe de Ribera (no. 63), which was unattributed in the paintings appraisal. Villanueva del Fresno's other Ribera painting, a large St. Sebastian, was also unattributed in the appraisal (perhaps no. 15 or 35?). A further modern painting listed anonymously in the valuation was a painting of the Virgin attributed to Rubens in the inventory alone (f. 17, otra pintura de nuestra señora de de [sic] Rubenes con moldura negra). Perhaps these omissions on the part of the appraisers reflected their skepticism in front of the works, or perhaps these are merely inconsistencies of the kind that often occur in documents of this type. Villanueva del Fresno's royal portraits were headed by those of the king and queen, and included two of the Infante Don Carlos and two of the Cardinal-Infante Don Ferdinand. An unusual aspect of the House of Austria series, however, were three portraits of Prince Philip (IV), one as a child in a carriage, another aged fourteen and another aged sixteen. In stark contrast to these portraits, the marqués also owned paintings of heads of strange figures (no. 107), perhaps comic images, and a painting of two madmen making an obscene gesture (no. 81). A portrait of a bearded woman (no. 117) reflects an interest in such miracles of nature among this class. One of the portraits appears to have represented the Toledan painter Blas de Prado (no. 82), and two other paintings were portrait images of artists at work. One interesting painting listed in the inventory as a half-length portrait of Alonso Sánchez portraying his majesty Philip II (Otra pintura de un Retrato de medio cuerpo de alonso sanchez Retratando a su mag.d felipe segundo Con moldura negra y dorada, AHPM, Prot. 5.201, f. 13) would appear to be a painting listed in the appraisal simply as a portrait of Alonso Sánchez Coello (no. 61). This could have been a self-portrait of the royal painter that celebrated his royal favor in a way analogous to Velázquez's Las Meninas years later. This subject would also seem to relate to another painting mentioned only in Villanueva del Fresno's valuation which depicted a sculptor making a head of Philip II (no. 50). This was surely the portrait attributed to El Greco (now in an English private collection) that represents a sculptor, perhaps Pompeo Leoni, making a marble bust of Philip II, an image that is the direct precedent for Velázquez's portrait of Juan Martínez Montañés making a bust of Philip IV (Madrid, Museo del Prado) (See H.E. Wethey, El Greco and His School, Princeton, 1962, p. 34, notes 62, 63; M. Estella, Los Leoni, escultores entre Italian y España in Madrid, Prado, Los Leoni (1509-1608), exhibition catalogue, May-July 1994, p. 47, fig. 17).

(See M. Hermina Balado, La Condesa de Lemos y la corte de Felipe III, 1949; A. Pardo Manuel de Villena, Marqués de Rafael, Un mecenas español del siglo XVII. El conde de Lemos, Madrid, 1911. Also A. Feros Carrasco, Gobierno de corte y patronazgo real en el reinado de Felipe III (1598-1618), unpublished thesis, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, 1986, pp. 74-75; Schroth 1990.)  She was the sister of Philip III's valido Francisco Gómez de Sandoval y Rojas, Duque de Lerma. After the death of Lerma's wife in 1603, he maintained control of the queen's household, a potential focus of political opposition, through his sister, who was camarera mayor of Queen Margarita. The condesa's political influence with her brother, as well as her great piety, was acknowledged by the Duke of Mantua and Grand Duke of Tuscany, who sent her valuable devotional objects for her oratory in 1603 (Rooses and Ruelens, Codex Diplomaticus Rubenianus, vol. I, Antwerp, 1887-1909, pp. 80, 85, 219). Fernando Ruíz de Castro had been Viceroy of Naples from 1599 until his death, as was his son Pedro Fernández de Castro, 7th Conde de Lemos, between 1610 and 1616. His family connection with Italy may have been important in the supply of Italian art to the Lerma clan in Spain. For instance, it was most probably the 7th Conde de Lemos, acting Viceroy of Naples between 1601-1603, who was responsible for sending to his nephew the Duque de Lerma an excellent copy of Raphael's Madonna of the Fish (Madrid, Prado), then in San Domenico, Naples (Schroth 1990, pp. 139-140). It was probably the 7th Conde de Lemos (d. 1622) whom Carducho referred to among the prominent art collectors at the Spanish court in 1633 (Carducho, ed. 1979, p. 444). (The only known inventory of the latter's paintings is that drawn up in 1648 on the death of his widow Catalina de la Cerda y Sandoval: Duque de Berwick y Alba, Discursos leídos ante la Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando, Madrid, 1924, p. 90). The notarized inventory of the estate of the Condesa de Lemos was begun in Madrid on 19 February 1628 (AHPM, Prot. 2.300, ff. 711-819). This document helps to clarify a somewhat confusing list of paintings from the Lemos estate published by the Duque de Berwick y de Alba (Duque de Berwick y Alba, Discursos leídos ante la Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando, Madrid, 1924, p. 90). The fact that the attributions were exclusively to Italian artists (in addition to Dürer and Bosch) indicates a distinct bias in the family's taste. The earliest Italian picture listed was a Virgin and Child, attributed to either Mantegna or Giovanni Bellini (no. 66). The most famous Italian masters of the High Renaissance i.e. Raphael, Leonardo, Correggio and Michelangelo, were represented in the collection by copies, a taste shared with the Duque de Lerma. The Lemos painting after Raphael's St. John in the Desert (no. 2) was a copy of the popular composition in Florence from Raphael's workshop, another copy of which Lerma acquired in 1603 (Schroth 1990, pp. 132-133). There was also a copy of Correggio's Mystic Marriage of St. Catherine (no. 1), one of many cited in Spanish inventories. The Michelangelo copy of a Holy Family (no. 51) was painted by one Mateo de Marcelo, which may refer to Marcello Venusti. However, this may refer to the son of the Valladolid painter Gregorio Martínez called Marcello Martínez; paintings by both father and son decorated the Duque de Lerma's church of San Pablo, Valladolid (Op. cit, pp. 66-67). (The Duque de Lerma gave a copy of another painting of the Holy Family described as copia de Marcello to the convent of San Pablo (Valladolid) in 1609, Garcia Chico 1946, vol. 3, part 1, pp. 385-387.) One of the three Raphael copies (nos. 2, 19, 52) depicting Christ with symbols of the Evangelist was valued at 350 ducats in 1629 and given to Miguel de Moscoso, Archbishop of Segovia (Berwick y Alba 1924, p. 90). Like Lerma, the condesa also owned Florentine works, and one of the most important was her large Penitent Magdalene by Bronzino, which served as the altarpiece in one of her oratories. There was also a copy of the miraculous thirteenth-century Annunciation from SS. Annunziata, Florence (no. 29), which was popular among collectors of Lerma's circle. (Schroth, 1990, p. 67 suggests that Lemos' picture was a copy after Fra Angelico's Annunciation (Madrid, Prado, Fig. 28) which Lerma received in 1611. This seems unlikely.) Lerma's own copy was painted in 1603 by Alessandro Allori, and the copy by Allori that exists at the Escorial was made for Philip II in 1585 (Schroth, 1990, pp. 25, 141). Lerma and his sister may also have exchanged pictures, and the condesa had given him a life-sized Christ for his cell at Lerma (X. Brooke, The patronage and art collection of the Duke of Lerma, M.Phil. thesis, Courtauld Institute of Art, 1983, p. 109, no. 57). Lerma owned a portrait of his sister painted by Alonso Sánchez Coello (Schroth 1990, pp. 34, 167). A widow from 1601, the Condesa de Lemos appears to have been extremely pious, and this is reflected in the predominantly religious nature of her collection of paintings, the majority of which decorated her oratory. The lack of Venetian art was unusual for a noble collection of this time, and there was only a single religious painting by the Bassani listed in the collection (nos. 44). A Virgin and Child by Scipione Gaetano (no. 28) might exemplify the piety that was characteristic of the condesa's taste. The collection also included a large work of Mary Magdalene Searching for Christ in the Sepulchre by Procachino, perhaps Giulio Cesare Procaccini. Apart from portraits, the only profane subjects listed were landscapes, some with genre scenes which a later inventory of 1648 attributed to Paul Bril and Jan Brueghel (Berwick y de Alba 1924, p. 90). No still lifes were listed in the collection, but a painting of a skull (no. 37) represented an older Vanitas tradition. Another modern Italian painting in the collection was a large Saint Christopher with the Christ Child by Orazio Borgianni (no. 129), which is perhaps identifiable with a version in the Milicua collection in Barcelona (A.E. Pérez Sánchez, Borgianni, Cavarozzi y Nardi en España, Madrid, 1964, pp. 15, 45, no. 5). Borgianni visited Spain and found favor with the Lerma group, and he was also protected by 7th Conde de Lemos during his viceroyship of Naples between 1610-1616 (Pérez Sánchez 1964, p. 12). Indeed, a copy of a Borgianni painting of the Agony in the Garden in the collection of Doctor Juan de Matute (Doc. 14, no. 16) was given to Lemos, who was said to value it at 1,000 ducats.","Collectors Files:  Lemos, Catalina de Zúñiga, Condesa de","input"

Mendoza was cousin of the Duque de Lerma and nephew of Bernardo de Sandoval y Rojas, Archbishop of Toledo. As Marqués de San Germán, Mendoza began his career as Gentilhombre de la Cámara del Rey (1599) and was made Marqués de la Hinojosa in 1612 (See Feros Carrasco, p. 141). He was son of Don Juan de Mendoza, the general of the Spanish fleet, and also pursued a military career, serving under Lerma in the Spanish cavalry and receiving an appointment to the Council of War in 1605. In 1607, he was made capitán general of naval artillery, and his private collection included a painting of his entry into the port of San Sebastián in this capacity (no. 34), as well as paintings of Spanish ports (nos. 46, 50). He not only survived the change of regime on Lerma's fall, but also went on to become the confidante of the Conde-Duque de Olivares, and ambassador to England in 1623 (See Elliott 1986, pp. 212, 214). Hinojosa served in Italy as governor of Milan from 1612 until his recall in disgrace in 1615, when he was appointed to the Consejo de Estado (Elliott 1986, pp. 55-56). Despite his political and military failure in Italy, his postmortem inventory in Madrid in 1628 listed a series of ten pictures commemorating his military exploits against the Duchy of Savoy in 1615 (nos. 32 and 33 ). He may even have presented the Duque de Lerma with a set of six of these paintings, which were hung in the public gallery at Lerma by 1617 (Brooke, p. 106, no. 20; Schroth 1990, p. 81). Hinojosa's collection also included a painting of his capture of the African port of Larache in 1610 (no. 49), as well as two portraits of himself (nos. 45, 67). In having such self-aggrandizing paintings made, Hinojosa was probably following the precedent of Lerma himself, who, ever conscious of the need to glorify his family, had commissioned a painting in 1606 from Vicencio Carducho of the Siege of Antequera by his illustrious military predecessor, Diego Gómez de Sandoval (Schroth 1990, pp. 41, 201). To these can be added a parallel example of the collection of another soldier, Don Lope de Hoçes y Córdoba, who owned autobiographical military paintings of his own campaigns that are listed in his inventory of 1645 (AHPM, Prot. 6.015, ff. 795v-796; Getty Provenance Index No. E-156) and exist today in the Prado. Although Hinojosa was fully aware of the value of paintings to manifest power and status, from the evidence of his inventory, at least, it is probably true to say that he was less interested in collecting pictures for aesthetic enjoyment than other members of his clan. Apart from the paintings directly relating to his own military career, Hinojosa's collection consisted mostly of religious subjects, portraits, and landscapes. There were various series of portraits (no. 40), hermit saints (no. 18), and a set of miracles of St. Charles Borromeo (no. 19), which were perhaps copies of paintings in the Duomo of Milan, as were those that his cousin, the Duque de Lerma, donated to San Blas, Valladolid (Schroth 1990, pp. 84-85). In 1626 Cassiano dal Pozzo had visited the palace of the Marqueses de la Hinojosa, where he had admired the quality of paintings in the oratory, including three works by the Milanese artist Cerano, and paintings by Artemesia Gentileschi and Vouet (Simón-Díaz 1980, p. 202). A number of Hinojosa's paintings also reflect an interest in Spain's South American colonies (nos. 35, 47, 48). A set of 12 months may have been paintings of above-average aesthetic merit, and may be identifiable with 12 landscapes on panel worth 40 ducats each listed among the pictures of Ana María de Mendoza, Marquesa de la Hinojosa, on her death in 1642 (AHPM, Prot. 7.671, ff. 1002-1027v). Hinojosa owned portraits of Italian women (nos. 36, 40, 42, 43), and some of his pictures were probably acquired during his viceroyalty in Milan. He owned two still lifes, one of some partridges on a tray (no. 41) and another of grapes and peaches on a tray (nos. 30), whose descriptions recall early Lombard pictures by Ambrogio Figino and Panfilo Nuvolone and which may have been brought to court as souvenirs of his residence in Italy. Hinojosa's still life with grapes and peaches could have been a version of a still life by Nuvolone dated 1620 in a private collection in Milan (Zeri and Porzio 1989, I, pl. 257).","Collectors Files:  Hinojosa, Juan de Mendoza, Marqués de","input"

D. Martin de Saavedra Guzmán y Galindo, Knight of Calatrava, Gentilhombre del Smo Príncipe Don Carlos, Residente al preste en Madrid, says his father D. Gonzalo de Saavedra, vecino of Córdoba, has lent him 1000 ducados de vellon y plata = 45551 reales Para mis negocios y necesidades, and in case he should die before repaying this money, he draws up an inventory of the goods he presently owns. C.F. paintings, ff. 577-577v.'","By a document signed in Madrid on 17 November 1630, Don Martín de Saavedra Guzmán y Galindo, Gentilhombre del Serenisimo Príncipe Don Carlos (d.1632), and knight of the Order of Calatrava, borrowed 1,000 copper ducats and 4,551 silver reales from his father, Don Gonzalo de Saavedra, a citizen of Córdoba. Don Martín drew up an inventory of his goods (bienes muebles) that comprised his collection of paintings, furnishings, a reliquary, and marble statue of Christ and the Virgin, with some items of silver, all of which he sent to his father in Córdoba for safekeeping and which acted as security for the loan. Although the reason for raising the loan was given merely as business and necessities, it is not beyond the realm of possibility that Don Martín was intending to travel outside Spain. A portrait of the viceroy of Sicily, Prince Manuel Philibert of Savoy (1588-1624), in the collection (no. 34) suggests an Italian connection. It is proof of the high regard in which the collection of paintings was held that this headed Don Martin's inventory and was a principal element in guaranteeing such a large loan of money. The fact that the owner himself drew up the list of his own pictures accounts for the high rate of attributions in this document. Although the paintings were not valued, in the case of originals the artists' names testified to their authenticity. Originals were distinguished from copies, and copies after named artists were probably works of quality. In the case of one anonymous Flemish painting (no. 28), it was affirmed that it was painted de un flamenco baliente. The inventory did not identify the hands of Spanish artists working at home, unless the picture of a man being bled by Cardilo (no. 23) represented a work by Vicencio Carducho. However, Jusepe de Ribera was represented by a copy after a painting of St. Bartholomew, although the document does not specify whether this depicted the saint alone or undergoing his martyrdom (no. 7). Another picture was copied from a Virgin by su suegro del españoletto (no. 21), which referred to Ribera's father-in-law the Sicilian painter Gian Bernardino Azzolino. A further Neapolitan connection is suggested by the cityscapes of Naples and Venice painted by an artist identified only as monsieur de napoles (no. 30), perhaps referring to Didier Barra (Monsú Desiderio), who was the foremost painter of vedute in Naples of the time. Although this was a relatively small collection of paintings, a broad range of subject matters was represented. The landscapes with ruins (nos. 31, 32) bring to mind works painted in Rome by the colony of northern artists, among others. A number of subjects from classical mythology suggest a liberal, Italianate taste on the part of this collector (nos. 17, 35, 36). His sophistication did not, however, prevent him appreciating a small genre painting of a figure drinking (no. 26). The most remarkable aspect of this collection, however, is the presence of an original and four copies of paintings by Caravaggio. The St. Thomas, thought to be an original by Don Martín (no. 20), could have been a version of the Doubting Thomas painted for the Marchese Giustiniani (Potsdam, Sanssouci Bildergalerie). It is difficult to know which prototypes were behind the copies of St. Jerome (no. 16) and St. John (the Baptist) (no. 10), although the copy of St. Lucy (no. 5) may have been related to Caravaggio's late painting of the Burial of St. Lucy for the church of St. Lucy at Syracuse, Sicily. The Toothpuller (no. 24) was probably copied from the Caravaggesque painting of this subject now in the Palazzo Pitti, in Florence. Don Martín's taste was clearly for naturalistic paintings, the works of Caravaggio, the early Ribera, and even the painting by Cardilo (no. 23) which was expressly said to be taken from nature. This did not, however, stand in his way of his appreciation of the ideal style of Raphael, by whom he owned copies of a Virgin (no. 13) and, conversely, a Venus (no. 17).","Collectors Files:  Saavedra Guzmán y Galindo, Martín de","input"

[Daughter Ana was the third wife of Francisco Fernández de la Cueva, 7th Duque of Alburquerque, and he is listed as beneficiary here in referring to her (their) share.]","If one were to evaluate the relative status of Spanish Golden Age collections solely on the basis of contemporary reports, the collections of the Almirantes de Castilla (Duques de Medina de Rioseco) and their wives, who were called the Duquesas de Medina de Rioseco, would probably be considered the finest. If we were, on the other hand, to base our valuation solely on the documentation of the collection presented here -- a body of data spanning nearly the entire seventeenth century -- we would perhaps be less willing to displace the Carpios, Leganés, and the other leading collections of the age. This should serve as a warning about the limits of inventories as interpretive documents -- we are clearly in the hands of the tasadores who made the appraisals, or of the heirs of the collector, who may or may not have preserved information about the authorship of the works. It should also temper our reliance on the hearsay of visitors' reports. Nevertheless, combining the reports with the documents, we may assert that the almirante's collection was among the best in the Golden Age. With regard to the documents presented here, we may cite the following members of the Enríquez de Cabrera family active as collectors: Doña Victoria Colonna, dowager Duquesa de Medina de Rioseco, widow of the 8th Almirante de Castilla. Condesa de Modica (in her own right), who died 28 December 1633. She was the mother of D. Juan Alfonso Enríquez de Cabrera, 9th Almirante de Castilla. Her inventory was taken at Madrid beginning 5 January 1634. (The present document.) Don Juan Alfonso Enríquez de Cabrera, Duque de Medina de Rioseco, 9th Almirante de Castilla, who was born in 1597 and died in 1647. Don Juan Alfonso was orphaned at the age of three; he thus came into possession of his estates in 1600. He served as Mayordomo Mayor to Philip IV in the 1630s, was appointed Viceroy of Sicily in 1641, and was Viceroy of Naples from 1644 to 1646. (See Doc. 43.) Doña Luisa de Sandoval, widow of Don Juan Alfonso Enríquez de Cabrera, 9th Almirante de Castilla; she died in 1664. (See Doc. 74.) Don Juan Gaspar Enríquez de Cabrera, Duque de Medina de Rioseco, 10th Almirante de Castilla, who was born in 1625 and died before September 25, 1691. (See Doc. 117.) Don Juan Thomas Enríquez de Cabrera, Duque de Medina de Rioseco, 11th Almirante de Castilla, who opposed Philip V and fled to Portugal in 1702, and his brother, Don Luis Enríquez de Cabrera, Marqués de Alcañizas. Although the 11th almirante's inventory is not of great interest, the documents surrounding the sequestration of his property by the crown included copies of the 9th almirante's 1647 inventory, already cited. For further information, see the document-specific comments appended to the other Almirante inventories included in this volume (Docs. 43, 74, and 117), as well as the discussion in the Introduction. The present document is the inventory of Doña Victoria Colonna, dowager Duquesa de Medina de Rioseco, Condesa de Modica (in her own right), who died 28 December 1633. She was the mother of Don Juan Alfonso Enríquez de Cabrera, 9th Almirante de Castilla, and the widow of the 8th Almirante. The inventory was taken by Don Juan Alfonso at Madrid beginning 5 January 1634, with the paintings inventoried 9 January 1634 (ff. 90-100) and 7 March 1634 (ff. 146-149v). In addition to Don Juan Alfonso, her heirs included Don Francisco Fernández de la Cueva and Doña Ana Enríquez de Cabrera y Colonna, Duques de Alburquerque (for her death inventory, see Doc. 68), and Doña Feliche Enríquez Colonna, Duquesa de Lerma. The collection as inventoried contained more than 250 paintings, all of which were left unattributed to any artist, and most of which depicted religious subjects, primarily individual saints. The exceptions were portraits, mostly of family members, a few landscapes and four paintings of The Seasons. Only one item stands out thematically, a work described as depicting Cleopatra feeding an old man with her breast. This was clearly a representation of Cimon and Pero (Roman Charity) which the person making the inventory has incorrectly identified. The erotic overtones of this painting are in stark contrast to the rows of male and female saints that must have surrounded it.","Collectors Files:  Castilla, Victoria Colonna, Condesa de Módica, Duquesa de Medina de Ríoseco y [esposa del] Almirante de","input"

Gachard in Biographie nationale belge, I, 1866, cols. 388-401.","This document is a record of the picture collection of the Flemish prince Philippe Charles d'Arenberg, Duc d'Aarschot y Prince-Comte d'Arenberg (1587-1640) (See Jacques Descheemaeker, Histoire de la Maison d'Arenberg d'après les archives françaises, Neuilly, 1969; Biographie Nationale...de Belgique, t. 1, Brussels, 1866, s.v. Arenberg, Philippe-Charles, prince-comte d' by L-Pr. Gachard, pp. 388-401, 406-410; J.H. Elliott, The Count-Duke of Olivares, New Haven and London, 1986, pp. 463, 467-472). Although Aarschot was received with great honours at the Spanish court when he arrived in Madrid in 1633, he was suspected of involvement in the rebellion of the Flemish nobles in 1632 and of negotiating with the Dutch to secure the independence of Flanders from Spain. He was arrested after a royal audience on Easter Sunday, 15 April 1634, and imprisoned outside Madrid on charges of high treason against the king. From December 1634, Aarschot lived under house arrest in the capital, and at the beginning of 1637 was joined by his wife, Marie-Cléophée de Hohenzollern, and their son, Philippe-François, who lived at a separate address. The case against Aarschot was never proved, but he died before Philip IV could rehabilitate him, aged fifty-two, on 25 September 1640. His wife left Madrid on 6 June 1641, while his son remained at the Spanish court to pursue a miltary career (he was made a Knight of the Golden Fleece in 1646). The postmortem inventory of Aarschot's goods in the Madrid palace, Casa de las Siete Chimeneas, was begun on 26 September 1640, drawn up by his widow and executors, Fray Pedro de la Concepción, Julian de la Visitación, and the licenciado Don Diego de Altamirano (Doc. 35). The paintings of the duc's gallery were inventoried between 26-28 September 1640. The inventory of the duc's paintings in the houses on the calle de Alcalá inhabited by the duc's widow and their son, which were owned by Don Rodrigo de Herrera (see Doc. 33), was resumed on 2 October 1640. Aarschot's collection, numbering some 400 paintings, was valued on 9 August 1641, by two painters, Antonio de Puga (1602-48) and Juan de la Corte. Puga's own estate inventory testifies to his thriving painting practice, although only one signed work by him is known today, a St. Jerome which is itself a copy of a painting by Francisco Collantes (Angulo and Pérez Sánchez 1983, p. 262, no. 21). Puga appears to have worked extensively for Aarschot. A notarized set of the duc's accounts during his residence in Spain shows that Puga received a payment of 1,900 reales for unspecified work between September and November 1638 (AHPM, Prot. 5.985, ff. 554v-555). As well as valuing the duc's collection, Puga oversaw the 2 October 1640, inventory of his paintings. Three unfinished portraits listed in the inventory were said to be in Puga's aposento, perhaps referring to his quarters in the palace. One was a large unfinished family group portrait, over six varas long, of the duc, the duchesse, and their son (mas Un quadro comencado de seis varas de largo del Retrato del duque y La duquesa su muger y El principe su hijo que no esta Acavado de hacer), and the two others were unfinished full-lengths of the duc and his son. If not the same picture, the duc's portrait must be related to the unfinished portrait of Aarschot that was inventoried in Puga's studio on his death in 1648 (Angulo and Pérez Sánchez 1983, p. 266, no. 28). A landscape by the painter who portrayed the duke alive (del pintor que retratta al duque vivo) may also have been by Puga. Aarschot's inventory also listed a further unframed full-length of the duc and a painting of the head of the deceased duc. Puga was paid 450 reales in two installments in April 1638 and 16 February 1639, for a portrait of the duc and duchesse, inventoried in her quarters. Another painter, Jean Ducamps (Cambrai ca.1600-1650 Madrid), known in Spain as Juan del Campo, was paid 1,100 reales in September 1639 for a portrait of the prince, probably Philippe-François (para el retrato del Príncipe mi señor en manos de Juan de Champ pintor) (AHPM, Prot. 5.985, f. 692v). Puga's copy of one of Aarschot's most important pictures, Rubens' Wolf Hunt (Fig. 33), was inventoried as unfinished in Aarschot's collection on 27 September 1640. The artist was paid 600 reales on account for this painting in the autumn of 1640 (a quenta de la copia que hace de una pintura de rubens que es una Cassa de lobos, AHPM, Prot. 5.985, f. 784v) and on 11 April 1641, Puga wrote in his own hand and signed a receipt for the total of 1,500 reales por la copia de la pintura grande de Rubenes (AHPM, Prot. 5.993, f. 1181). This copy was probably the picture listed in the collection of Don Diego de Altamirano (see Doc. 35, no. 55), where it was valued by Puga himself at 2,000 reales, higher than any other picture in the collection. The picture may have been given to Altamirano, who was a close friend, one of Aarschot's executors, and the author of a defense of the duc. It may be identifiable with the copy in the Hermitage, St. Petersburg (240 x 363.5 cm.), a painting with an eighteenth-century provenance about which very little is known (Balis 1986, pp. 95-96). In 1800, Ceán Bermúdez mentioned a set of six genre paintings signed and dated by Puga in 1653 (perhaps a mistake for 1635) in the Madrid collection of Don Silvestre Collar y Castro, Secretary of the Council of Indies (Ceán Bermúdez 1800, vol. IV, p. 134). A group of five genre paintings valued in Aarschot's gallery are worth mentioning in this context. These relatively valuable paintings were listed as a painting of a blind guitarist, another of a knife and scissors grinder, a female tripe vendor, an oil seller, and another of a tavern with wine being sold and smokers. Although they were unattributed and their sizes were not given, the unusual subject matter of three of them corresponds with genre paintings carrying a traditional attribution to Puga: a Knife Grinder (St. Petersburg, Hermitage), an Oil Vendor (Castres, Musée Goya) and a Tavern Scene with Wine Selling and Smokers (Pontevedra, Museo) (See Angulo and Pérez Sánchez 1983, pp. 263-265). The paintings were sold on 7 October 1641 to one Don Juan de Velasco for 600 reales each (AHPM, Prot. 5.993, f. 1267v). A further picture of a negro grinding chocolate listed in Aarschot's inventory may well be the picture of this subject that was later known to be in the possession of Don Diego de Altamirano (Doc. 35, no. 59). It does not appear to have formed part of the set of five other genre pictures. It is not certain, however, that the latter formed a series by a single hand. One of the most interesting genre pictures in Aarschot's collection was a portrait of a member of his own household, inventoried as the bodegón where the steward of his excellency is portrayed (el bodegon donde esta Retratado El desPensero de ssu ex.a con moldura de pino dada de negro) (AHPM, Prot. 5.993, f. 1135). In the valuation of the paintings, the sitter was said to be cutting beef, with mutton and a goat, and the picture was worth the large sum of 1,100 reales (no. 36). It was bought, along with four other pictures, on 3 October 1641, by Pedro de Tapia, porter of the Council of Italy, and the sitter's name was given as Mundin (otro de un despensero que se llama mundin) (AHPM, Prot. 5.993, f. 1266). This painting may have had some relationship with the anonymous genre masterpiece painted in Madrid in the 1630s called the Bodegón Keeper (Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum), in which the figure of the cook is clearly painted from a live model (Jordan 1985, pp. 236-238, no. 45). Juan de la Corte (ca. 1597-ca. 1660) was a Flemish painter who had been affiliated with the court since 1615 and who specialized in painting biblical, historical, and mythological subjects with small figures, sometimes with elaborate perspectival settings, as well as scenes from contemporary life at court. Aarschot may have become interested in De la Corte because of his Flemish background, although the artist's great popularity among collectors is attested to by the number of his works cited in seventeenth-century inventories. In the duc's accounts for 2 January, 24 April, and 12 July 1638, payments totaling 1,140 reales were made to De la Corte for unspecified paintings (AHPM, Prot. 5.985, ff. 552, 553, 554). Perhaps these included the equestrian royal portraits of all the house of Austria by Juan de la Corte with landscapes painted by Puga, of which Camilo Guidi informed the Duca di Modena in a letter of 20 November 1641, adding that these artists were the most esteemed for this work at court and that their price was 180 ducats each (Angulo and Pérez Sánchez 1969, p. 356, no. 46). The paintings were probably commissioned directly from the artists by Aarschot, and were perhaps a pointed and poignant demonstration of his loyalty to the Spanish Crown. A set of eight equestrian portraits of members of the House of Austria, worth 3,600 reales, was listed in the first of Aarschot's rooms to be appraised. Two further sets of equestrian portraits of European princes, comprising 12 and 20 pictures, respectively, were listed as decorating the quarters of two members of Aarschot's household. The document specified that eight of these representing the Spanish Habsburgs were to remain together as a single group (Philip I, Charles V, Philip II, Philip III, Philip IV, Cardinal Infante Don Ferdinand, Infante Don Carlos, and Prince Baltasar Carlos). Puga may have painted some of these portraits, as his studio inventory listed sketches for equestrian portraits of Philip IV and the Cardinal Infante, as well as the Conde-Duque de Olivares (Angulo and Pérez Sánchez 1983, p. 266, nos. 24, 27, 29). A set of 13 full-length royal portraits owned by Aarschot were valuable paintings, worth 880 reales each. Another set of 39 full-lengths comprised the Spanish Habsburgs, European royals and nobles, and the Conde-Duque de Olivares; they were worth 660 reales each. The most intriguing royal portrait of all in the collection was a large and valuable (2,000 reales) picture of Queen Isabella of Bourbon, inventoried in the duquesa's household (no. 15), which depicted the queen and her ladies-in-waiting passing through a room represented in perspective, its walls adorned with portraits of the Spanish queens. This painting's subject matter and large size (31/2 x 2 varas and 3 dedos) make it a suggestive precedent for Velázquez's Las Meninas. The painting may have been by Juan de la Corte, who painted group portraits of the royal family in perspectival and garden settings. (See Introduction of Collections of Paintings in Madrid 1601-1755, 1997, for a picture inventoried in the collection of Juana Siburi y Espinola in 1646, which is probably Juan de la Corte's Family of Philip IV in a Garden in the Stirling Collection, Kier, Scotland.) Very few of the paintings in Aarschot's inventories were attributed. About one-quarter of the collection was made up of still lifes, flower paintings, and genre pictures. Some 50 paintings hung in the galeria: large hunting scenes, landscapes, still lifes, a mythology, and a set of genre pictures. Aarschot bought Spanish pictures while in Madrid, and the documents list works attributed to Francisco de Collantes and Eugenio Caxés, including one listed in the inventory which may have been a self-portrait (otro quadro de una Caveca y pintura de medio cuerpo con marco negro que se dice es Una cabeca de un pintor Eujenio cajes) (AHPM, Prot. 5.993, f. 1113). However, their descriptions suggest that the majority of his paintings were of Flemish origin, and may have been drawn from his collection in Brussels. A number of flower and landscape paintings attributed to Brueghel were probably by Jan Velvet Brueghel, and one Night Scene with St. Jerome was by Abraham Bloemart. The set of accounts of Aarschot's expenses in Spain between 1633-1640 (AHPM, Prot. 5.985, ff. 495ff) lists payments of 1,600 reales on 9 November and 5 December 1639, for six unspecified paintings that Gaspar de Crayer (Gaspar van Ecre) was painting for the duc (AHPM, Prot. 5.985, ff. 556, 556v), another 900 reales paid on 2 January 1639 (f. 626) and a further 500 reales on 10 April 1639 (ff. 650-650v, to Gaspar van Eyken pintor). Although personal enmity existed between Aarschot and Peter Paul Rubens, his collection included a famous example of the artist's early work, his enormous Wolf Hunt now in the Metropolitan Museum (Fig. 33), which hung with other large hunting scenes in Aarschot's gallery (no. 65). There was also a copy of a Nativity of Christ by Rubens (Prot. 5.993, f. 136) and a number of prints after his paintings and those of Jacob Jordeans, which were probably those bought in Antwerp on behalf of the duc in 1638 and July 1640 (Prot. 5985, ff. 590v, 762v). Rubens had painted the Wolf Hunt on speculation ca. 1615-16, and Aarschot, who was grand falconer of the Netherlands and chief huntsman of Flanders, had bought it in 1616-17, probably having the work shipped to Spain with other pictures from his collection after his confinement (A. Balis, Corpus Rubenianum Ludwig Burchard XVIII, II The Hunting Scenes, 1986, pp. 22-25, 95-107, no. 2). Aarschot's interest in Flemish hunting pictures is also reflected in his purchase of hunts and subjects from Aesop's Fables by Paul de Vos between 1633 and 1640 (Balis 1986, p. 25). He also commissioned 24 paintings from Peter Snayers (Balis 1986, p. 25, no. 20). Some of these may have been sold to the Marqués de Povar. A sale of an unspecified number of paintings to Povar is recorded in Aarschot's accounts for 1638 (AHPM, Prot. 5.985, f. 550v), and the inventory of Gerónima Dávila y Guzmán, Marquesa de Povar, of 17 September 1641 lists 25 pictures of animals and six of birds bought from the Duque de Aarschot (AHPM, Prot. 6.208, ff. 910-943v; Getty Provenance Index No. E-32). Aarschot's collection included some Italian pictures, and his accounts mention six paintings sent from Genoa in March 1640, whose authors and subjects are unspecified (AHPM, Prot. 5.985, ff. 739v-740). However, his overriding taste for pictures from his native land is confirmed by a shipment of 38 paintings sent from Flanders, which reached Madrid after Arenberg's death and were inventoried on 11 May 1641 (Doc. 30) (AHPM, Prot. 5.993, ff. 1151-1153v). These paintings included subjects from biblical and classical history, mythologies, genre paintings, hunting scenes, flower paintings (one an original of Brueghel), and still lifes (two of which were originals by Alexander Adriensen). They were valued in different rooms in his palace by Puga and De la Corte in August 1641. Aarschot's estate sale, which began on 10 September 1641, was well attended by picture collectors in Madrid and also attracted international attention. The Duca di Modena was interested in acquiring 14 of Aarschot's hunting scenes by Paul de Vos. His ambassador in Madrid, Camilo Guidi, consulted Velázquez about their quality, but was warned that he would be competing with the Marqués de Leganés for the purchase of these works (K. Justi, Velázquez y su siglo, 1953, p. 616; J. Southorn, Patronage in Modena and Ferrara in the 17th century, Ph.D. thesis, Courtauld Institute of Art, London, 1985, vol. I, p. 155). Indeed, Leganés spectacular collection of Flemish paintings included more than 70 such works by Vos and Frans Snyders, among others. In Flanders Aarschot had come to know the Marqués de Leganés, President of the Supreme Council of Flanders and the greatest collector of Flemish art at the Spanish court. An Equestrian Portrait of Leganés in Aarschot's collection, which may have been painted while Leganés was in the north, was hung with five other equestrian portraits of Flemish and Italian nobles (nos. 77). The two men shared a common interest in Flemish art, which ranged from major artists to such minor masters as the still-life painter Alexander Adriensen, six of whose works Leganés bequeathed to the king (López Navío 1962, p. 319, nos. 1220-1225). On his arrival in Madrid at the end of 1633, Aarschot was lodged in Leganés' Madrid palace, which he described as a paradise on earth (Brown and Elliott, Palace for a King, 1986, p. 268, no. 39). Early in 1634, Aarschot had the States General pay for expensive copies of eight Flemish paintings that Leganés had been obliged to give to the king to furnish the Buen Retiro palace. Not surprisingly, Leganés bought significant pictures from Aarschot's collection at his estate auction in 1641. These included a group of four still lifes of laid tables that hung in Aarschot's gallery, two of which were identified as Dutch paintings in the inventory (AHPM, Prot. 5.993, ff. 1113, 1115, and 1133v, where two were described as Dos bodegones de olanda de Vidrios y cosas de comer). It is likely that Dutch still lifes in Madrid collections, as well as more common Flemish works, were an important influence on the still-life paintings of Antonio de Pereda. Leganés bought these four pictures on 7 October 1641, for 1,200 reales each (quatro bodegones con mesas pintadas y bidrios) (AHPM, Prot. 5.993, f. 1267), and they were inventoried in his own collection in 1655 as four Dutch still lifes valued at only 500 reales each. The most important of all Leganés' purchases was the large Wolf Hunt by Peter Paul Rubens now in New York. This painting was valued at 6,600 reales, revalued at 550 ducats, and sold to Leganés on 7 October 1641 for 4,400 reales. Leganés also acquired five other large hunting pieces that had hung in Aarschot's gallery: a tiger hunt that he bought on 7 October 1641 for 2,750 reales, three of wolves, dogs, and other animals, and a picture of a fowl hunt. All of these pictures were listed in Leganés' inventories of 1642 and 1655 (López Navío 1962, p. 316, nos. 1125, 1126, 1141-1144; Balis 1986, p. 100). The Wolf Hunt was appraised in his collection in 1655 at 2,200 reales, which was considerably less than its sale price fourteen years earlier. The sale of goods from the Duc d'Aarschot's estate had begun on 10 September 1641 (AHPM, Prot. 5.993, ff. 1241-1292). His executors experienced some difficulty, however, in selling paintings from the collection on the open market in Madrid. Puga and De la Corte lowered the reserve prices of some of the unsold pictures in a revaluation of 8 December 1641. Furthermore, the artist-appraisers authorized a further reduction of these values by one-third and even one-half if they remained unsold after three months from this date, attributing the difficulty of their sale to the lack of money that there is in these miserable times (la falta de dineros que ay en estos miseros tiempos).","Collectors Files: Arenberg, Prince-Comte d'","input"

[Agustin Ahoa y Torres, Rodrigo Yañez] [Valuation is more descriptive than revaluation.]","Don Rodrigo de Herrera (Medina del Campo 1578-1641 Madrid) was the illegitimate son of Melchor de Herrera, 1st Marqués de Auñón and Tesorero General de Su Magestad, and Inés Ponce de León (See Marqués del Saltillo, Casas madrileñas del pasado, Revista de la Biblioteca, Archivo y Museo, 1945, pp. 79-88). In the absence of male heirs from Melchor de Herrera's marriages, Don Rodrigo inherited his father's mayorazgo and became a Knight of the Order of Santiago in 1625. He lived in a house on the fashionable calle de Alcalá in front of the convent of San Hermenegildo. He appears to have derived a considerable income from the rental and sale of properties at court. The Marqués de Montesclaros lived in a house bought from Herrera, and Herrera rented quarters to the Duchesse d'Aarschot and her son in the Casa de las Siete Chimineas, opposite the convent of the Discalced Carmelites on the calle de Alcalá. Herrera's postmortem inventory, begun on 23 November 1641, was drawn up by his executors, who were his sister Doña Ana de Herrera y Ribera, Marquesa de Auñón; Fray Juan de Herrera, of the Order of Saint Dominic; and D. Alonso de Villarroel, Knight of Alcántara. Herrera's picture collection of some 138 works was appraised for auction by two painters, Antonio de Puga and Diego Polo (ca.1610-ca.1655), on 29 November 1641. The paintings that remained unsold were revalued by another painter, Julián González, on 10 January 1642. Despite the combined expertise of these artists, the only attributed pictures were 18 copies after Bassano, which included representations of the Last Supper, The Creation, and Allegories of the Seasons. Herrera's will shows that he had loaned some 30 paintings and some furniture to the Duque de Osuna and borrowed from the Príncipe de Esquilache eight small paintings to decorate his villa and garden outside town at Canillejas, which had belonged to Esquilache. In Herrera's last will and testament, he declared that he owned 180 paintings that decorated la galeria and other rooms of his house, some of which were very valuable and some of which were not hung since they were deshonestos. Herrera's postmortem inventory reveals that his picture collection was indeed unusual for the small number of religious subjects it contained. Only 15 religious paintings were listed, of which two were copies and three were landscapes. Against this was a high percentage of secular works, which were also the most valuable holdings. A picture described as a painter portraying a nude woman (no. 34) was revalued as apeles Retratando a una diosa and sold at auction to Don Rodrigo Yañez on 20 January 1642 as apeles retratando a su muger. Representing Apelles and Campaspe, this classical subject set the whole tenor of Herrera's remarkable collection of nude paintings. Moreover, the majority of the 18 identifiable mythological subjects in the collection probably depicted the female nude. These paintings included representations of the stories of Venus and Mars, Venus and Cupid, Diana and Actaeon, Danae and the Shower of Gold, and Leda and the Swan. The figure of Venus was identified in seven of the paintings. A further eight pictures of unidentified women (one seated with Cupid, two pictures of women lying on a bed, another of a woman lying in a landscape, and three with women bathing) are likely also to have represented nude or semi-nude figures, perhaps goddesses. At Herrrera's auction on 16 December 1641, the painter Jean Ducamps, known in Spain as Juan del Campo, purchased mythological pictures representing the stories of Venus, Diana, and Leda, which were listed without any veneer of erudition as five paintings of nude women. In fact, the notary, and perhaps the artist-appraisers, appear to have experienced some difficulty in identifying the story of Leda and the Swan; one picture was listed simply as a woman lying down with a swan (no. 54), while another was a nude woman lying down with a goose (no. 41) (This picture is described as Una benus con un cupido y Un cisne in the revaluation) and another much less valuable painting was a standing woman embracing a goose (no. 42). In his will, Herrera stipulated that his collection be sold in Italy rather than Spain. Acutely aware of the prevailing inhibitions in Spain regarding such paintings, perhaps he feared they would be confiscated by the Inquisition or perhaps he felt he could expect better prices on the more liberal art market abroad. The fact that nine of the paintings with nudes had to be reduced in value for sale at a second auction of Herrera's goods would seem to substantiate this consideration. The bulk of Herrera's picture collection, however, was sold at the public auction of his belongings, beginning on 6 December 1641. Among the more distinguished purchasers were the Duque de Maqueda (landscapes, religious subjects, mythologies, and genre paintings), Camilo Guidi, the Modenese Ambassador (a set of 12 equestrian portraits of Emperors), and the royal secretary Martín de Medina Lasso de Vega (paintings of the Seasons and a set of 12 portraits of the House of Austria). Paintings that remained unsold were reappraised at lower reserves by the painter Julian González on 10 January 1642 for a further estate sale resumed on 14 January 1642; these included three profane subjects sold to Don Rodrigo Yañez (Bath of Diana, Apeles portraying Campaspe, and a small painting of nude goddesses). Some of Herrera's mythologies were clearly valuable gallery paintings, while others were more decorative in nature and served as overwindows (nos. 19, 23). The most valuable mythologies were a painting depicting Fame and Mercury Teaching Cupid to Read (no. 16) and another of Venus and Mars (no. 37), worth 1,100 and 2,200 reales, respectively. The fact that the latter work was described as an original, an independent composition by the hand of a master, partly accounts for its high value and distinguished it from the rest of the mythologies, some of which were almost certainly copies. Not surprisingly, the painting was acquired at auction by a noble collector, the Duque de Maqueda, for 1,650 reales (10 December 1641). Herrera owned five genre paintings, four of which depicted female figures engaged in everyday activities. The most valuable of these represented a bodegón of fish with a woman and child in her arms. Three others may have been pendants, depicting a woman peeling an apple, washing a goose, and weighing fruit, respectively. Although such activities seem innocuous enough, Herrera clearly had a predilection for erotic subjects and may have enjoyed the sexual overtones in these genre scenes. A painting of Lot and His Daughters (no. 28) may also have appealed to him for this reason.","Collectors Files:  Herrera, Rodrigo de","input"

Pedro Fernández Tinoco and Manuel Fernández Tinoco]","The postmortem inventory and valuation of the estate of Don Fernando de Tinoco, a Knight of the Order of Christ and Treasurer of the Consejo de Portugal, and his wife Violante Correa, was drawn up on 14 October 1652, with their paintings valued by the painter Mateo Gallardo (ca.1600-1667) (ff. 35v-37).  The single most valuable painting in Gallardo's list was a St. John the Baptist by Pedro de Orrente (no. 3), worth 2,200 reales, followed by an unattributed Immaculate Conception, worth 1,500 reales (no. 18). Four large and valuable paintings of the story of Alexander the Great, however, headed the inventory (no. 1); while these were appraised at 400 ducats, they were not attributed in the document. They were conceivably by a Spanish hand, perhaps Juan de la Corte, if they depicted small figures. Tinoco owned a painting of St. Anthony by Vicencio Carducho (no. 5), and Mateo Gallardo at first mistook a picture of St. John the Evangelist for another Carducho (no. 4), perhaps because of their similarity of style. Gallardo immediately rectified his opinion and attributed the work to Carducho's contemporary and court colleague, Angelo Nardi. However, neither painting came near to the high valuation given to Orrente's St. John the Baptist (no. 3). Most of the religious paintings in Tinoco's collection were depictions of saints; two of these, representing St. Peter and the Magdalene (no. 13), were probably paired as penitent saints. A painting attributed to Veronese depicted the Four Elements in a single painting (no. 14), and was possibly painted after Veronese's frescoes in the Sala dell'Olimpio in the Villa Maser, which are his only known representations of these subjects. Tinoco, like many of his contemporaries, owned paintings in thematic sets. There was a set of 12 mythologies, whose subject matter was not specified (no. 20). A group of 12 paintings by Andrea Michieli represented the Twelve Months (no. 15). Other landscapes grouped in lots of twelve may also have represented the months (no. 21), and there was also a set of the Four Seasons (no. 6). Six perspectival scenes by Monsiur (no. 16) were perhaps by Monsu Didier Barra, who worked in Naples.","Collectors Files:  Tinoco, Fernando de","input"

II, doc. 2.12b; copy in the Archivo Histórico Nacional, Madrid","","","","Burke writes:  'Evaluation of the estate of Don Juan Alfonso Enríquez de Cabrera, 9th Almirante de Castilla.  The paintings were appraised August 7, 1647 by Antonio Arias, f. 326-362.  The paintings were assigned general inventory numbers from 243 to 1626 with many numbers omitted and some lots containing more than one picture.  There were also important tapestries (fols. 261-64), a large library (380-418), many statues and objets d'art, and a collection of picture frames (fols 445-448) with useful evaluations giving an idea of the worth of various types of frames. There are only minor variations between this document and the AHN copy.'","As has already been discussed in the Introduction and in the notes to Document 18, the collection of the 9th Almirante de Castilla caught the particular attention of contemporaries. We should especially recall the group of pictures given by the Almirante to Philip IV for the Escorial, the frames for which are noted in the present document with prices varying from 200 to 3,000 reales per frame (as much as was given to a large multi-figured composition). This is of interest not only for its documentation of the relationship with the royal collection but also, as we have noted, because the prices can be used as an internal benchmark to measure the values set on pictures. These suggest that the evaluator, Arias, had doubts about the authorship of works attributed to Bellini at only 350 reales, to Titian at 250, to Leonardo da Vinci at 250, or a number of portraits attributed to Titian at 80-132 reales. This is made explicit at lot number 92: a small picture of St. Roch, which they say is by the hand of Titian but is not...50 reales. Among the visitors to the Almirantes' collection was Graf Ferdinand Harrach, Imperial Ambassador to Madrid. Ambassador Harrach's account, dated in Madrid 16 May 1674, is of interest not only for the light it throws upon the gallery but also for the way in which it illustrates the acquisitive culture of the age, including tidbits on the Carpio and other collections (Published in Harrach, Ferdinand B., Graf, Tagebuch...1673-74, F. Mencik, ed., Vienna 1913, p. 91).  [16 May 1674]  Vormittag bin ich zu Haus geblieben, nachmittag in des Almirante Garten gangen un sein Gemähl gesehen, welche gar schön seind von denen besten Meistern und in grosser Menge, also dass mich gedunket, des Kaisers Galeria von dem Erzherzog Leopold gleiche disen nit in der Menge der gueten Bilder. Was ich gar absonderlich beobachtet ist, dass er ein Stuck von MICHAEL ANGELO BUONAROTA hat, welches er sehr estimirt, indeme dieser Mahler das meiste nur al fresco auf die Mauer gemahlt; einen gar kleines contrafait eines Cardinal von Titian, auf welche Weis er nit pfleget zu mahlen. Sonsten hat er die Zimmer gar wol abgetheilet, eines mit lauter Stuken von Titian, ein anderes von Tintoret, eines von Van Dyck, eines von Rubens (in welchem zwei Baurenstuk mit Landschaft und kleinen Figuren, so gar galant), ein anders Spagnolet, so sie hier Don Joseph de Ribera nennen, eines von Bassan, ein Kabinet von lauter kleinen Stucken von Breugl, dann andere Zimmer von unterschidlichen, al Raphael, Paul Veronese, Palma, und leztlich ein Zimmer von lauter Gemahl unterschidlichen spanischen Mahlern, al Mudo, Velasco, Careña [sic] und dergleichen. Die Ramen von denen Bildern seind unterschidlich, teils schwarz mit einer verguldten Leisten, theils ganz verguldt. Das Gebäu des Hauses is sonst schlecht und irregulier, und siht man, dass ein Stokel an das andere geflickt worden, inwendig aber mit unterschidlichen alcoven und Berschlag von Spiegelgläsern gar sauber geziert. ...[He mentions a garden with two water-play fountains.]...Die ganz läng des Garten lasst er Schupfen oder Gewölber machen in Form einer Galeria, auf selben eine Terasse mit seinen Palustren und Statuen....[a hermitage chapel]...Der Garten und Haus ligt al Prado viejo. Harrach also mentions (p. 51) the Equestrian Statue of Philip III (by Tacca) on the grounds of the Casa del Campo, as well as a visit to the gallery of the Duque del Infantado (p. 87), of which he gives no details. On May 30 1674, the Duque del Infantado sponsored a gala in honor of the feast of San Fernando (p. 95). Harrach also cites the works by Titian in the royal collection (p. 87), along with tapestries and statues, some of the latter being copies after ancient works in Rome. [p. 87] Habe ich dar [i.e., in the Royal Palace, probably the Alcázar] ein Invention gesehen, welche sie sagen, seie von dem verstorbenen König gewest. Da, wo die Correspondenz eines Gemahl gegen den anderen wegen Mangel des Orts nit hat sein künnen, hat er ein guetes Gemahl halben Theil copiren un die [R?]am auch halben Theil sezen lassen bis an die Mauer und damit zu verstehen geben wollen, der andere halbe Theil seie hinter der Mauer. He is shown around the palace by Carreño. He then (p. 88) visits some royal house in die Florida, where there is a garden and works by Van Dyck and Rubens (i.e., the Torre de la Parada?). [p. 71 - 4 March 1674]:  Nachmittag bin ich spazieren gefahren und habe meine Karl mitgenommen. Habe ein kleines Häusel, so der Ms. de Liche ein halbe Stund von hier hat, gesehen, so gar herzig ist.

A word might also be appended about the documents recording this collection. The inventory originally came to light because of a copy made ca. 1702 by notaries working to sequester the 11th almirante's estate after he had fled to Portugal during the events surrounding the War of the Spanish Succession. Subsequently, the original notarial documents of 1647 were located as follows: (a) [Original document - inventory] Madrid: AHPM, Prot. 6.314 (notary Francisco Suárez y Rivera, 1647 and misc.), ff. 1028-1090; dated in Madrid, 7 February - 19 June 1647; (b) [Original document - valuation] AHPM, Prot. 6.233 (notary Francisco Suárez y Rivera, 1647 III), ff. 258-452; dated in Madrid 25 June 1647 and subsequent, described as follows: Tasación de los bienes que quedaron por muerte del exmo. Sr. don Juan Alfonsso Enriquez de Cabrera [IX] Almirante de Castilla; (c) [Copy - valuation] Madrid: Archivo Histórico Nacional (AHN), Sección confiscos y secuestros, legajo 4, pza. 3a. (The AHN copy published by Fernández Duro in 1903 agrees with the original in the AHPM with only minor variations. Fernández Duro's no. 451 is specified in the 1647 document, no. 704, as being 12 maps from Italy (cartas Grandes de cosmografia que an Venido de italia). A handful of unimportant pieces were omitted from the copy, but have been restored here from the original.)

The AHN document is a certified copy from 1693 by the notary Juan de Medina of the original valuation subscribed beginning 17 November 1691 before the same notary.  This copy was made for the XI Almirante in order that the ducal records would match the information in the notarial archives.'  (notarial record has not been indentified)  This has many of the pictures from his parents' collection with more descriptions, but fewer attributions, although the works are arranged in rooms named after the principal painter represented there.'","In 1647, Juan Gaspar Enríquez de Cabrera inherited one of the largest Spanish collections of paintings from his father, Juan Alfonso Enríquez de Cabrera, the 9th Almirante de Castilla. Although Juan Gaspar, the 10th Almirante de Castilla, continued to acquire paintings, his activity as a collector consisted primarily in preserving, curating, and enhancing the collection. Juan Alfonso had amassed most of the collection during his years of service to King Philip IV. He had been mayordomo mayor to the king in the 1630s. In 1641, he was appointed Viceroy of Sicily, and in 1644, Viceroy of Naples, a position he held until 1646. His years in Italy gave him the opportunity to acquire Italian paintings and commission copies of some of the masterpieces of the Cinquecento, including a copy of Titian's Martyrdom of St. Lawrence (I Gesuiti, Venice). Not surprisingly, Juan Alfonso emulated the king's taste in his collecting practices. Consequently, Venetian paintings by Titian, Tintoretto, and the Bassani made up the largest and most valued part of the collection. In addition, he collected works from the Neapolitan school by Stanzione, Novelli, Falcone, and the Spaniard Jusepe de Ribera. The inventory taken after his death in June 1647, numbered more than 1,400 works, of which approximately 938 were paintings. Only the collections of Philip IV, the Marqués de Leganes, and the Marqués del Carpio included a greater number of paintings. Like most Spanish collections, the majority of the works were religious. There were also numerous landscapes, seascapes, and battle pictures; many of these were by Neapolitan painters such as Aniello Falcone and Viviano Codazzi. Unlike his father, Juan Gaspar never took an appointment abroad and would remain at court his entire life. In 1669, he was appointed to the Council of State by Charles II, and in 1683 was named caballerizo mayor. The 10th almirante rarely attended a meeting of the Council of State, but instead dedicated himself to cultivating a refined life at court, sponsoring splendid banquets, theatrical performances, and informal literary and artistic gatherings in his palace. A lover of the arts, Juan Gaspar wrote satiric poetry as well as two books, one on the art of bullfighting. Toward the end of his life, in 1683, he founded the convent church of the Discalced Franciscans known as San Pascual Bailón. Some of the best pictures in the collection, including five paintings by Ribera and two works by Guercino, were used to decorate this church, where he would be buried on September 25, 1691. Although most of Juan Gaspar's activity as a collector revolved around the organization and supervision of the collection he inherited from his father, bills of sale confirm that he continued to acquire paintings. In a sale of 1675, the 10th almirante purchased several works by Veronese. This was an important addition to the collection, since his father had given most of his paintings by this artist to the king sometime before his 1647 death inventory was taken. With these and other additions, the 10th almirante formed a kind of casa museo or house museum in his residence in the Paseo de Recoletos. (See also the Introduction for a discussion of sources of the 10th almirante's picture collection). Such an extensive collection required careful attention, and during the early 1670s Juan de Alfaro was employed as painter to the almirante (Palomino 1987, p. 251. Juan de Alfaro (ca. 1640-80) was a student of Velázquez, later wroting a manuscript on his life; and a close friend of Palomino.) His duties included restoration, as well as the creation of original works -- mainly portraits, and some small landscapes -- for the collection (Ibid). The 1691 inventory reveals that a large part of the collection was hung according to schools of painting and subject matter, with each room given a specific title. Although other contemporary collectors hung their paintings according to separate schools or genres, none of their inventories contain systematic room headings. This suggests that the titles in Juan Gaspar's inventory were probably official or formalized titles familiar to the notary who drew up the inventory and to Claudio Coello, who appraised the paintings. The titles of the rooms are the clearest reflection of the make-up of the collection, since the 1691 inventory rarely gives attributions for individual paintings. From it, one learns that there were individual rooms for Raphael, Tintoretto, Rubens, Titian, Bassano, Ribera, Pedro Orrente, and Spaniards. Interestingly, Ribera, who was considered the little Spaniard by the Italians, seems to have been singled out from the Spaniards because of his Italianate qualities, as was Orrente -- because of his Bassanesque qualities. In addition, there were rooms with genre titles: the Pieza de Paises, or plain landscapes, is distinguished from the Pieza de Perspectivas, which would have displayed landscapes with architecture, such as those by Codazzi. The Pieza de Españoles, or Room of Spaniards, included paintings by the leading Spanish artists such as Juan Carreño de Miranda, José Antolínez, Juan de Cabezalero, Antonio de Pereda, and Francisco de Herrera (the younger), all of whom met regularly at the 10th almirante's house to discuss artistic issues. (In his Lives of the Eminent Spanish Painters and Sculptors, Palomino specifically mentions works by each of these artists (except Cabezalero) in the almirante's Hall of the Eminent Spaniards, see 1987 edition, pp. 206, 232, 272, 275. Cabezalero is described as having executed a ceiling picture depicting God the father with some putti holding up the world in the almirante's chapel, next to the Augustinian Recoletos, p. 223.) Antonio de Pereda's Desengaño de la Vida (Kunsthistoriches, Wien, no. 771) can be identified as item no. 95 owing to the detailed and unique description. (This particular picture was probably purchased by his father Juan Alfonso, the 9th Almirante de Castilla. See Doc. 43, no. 368 un respice finem con quatro cavezas de Muertes, and Jordan and Cherry, Spanish Still Life from Velázquez to Goya, London 1995, p. 79-80.) Considering that Spanish collectors traditionally paid little attention to the national school in their collecting pursuits, the 10th almirante's Room of Spaniards reflects a markedly different attitude. It is for his patronage of the Spanish painters that Palomino upheld the 10th almirante as a model patron in his Lives of the Eminent Spanish Painters and Sculptors. The 10th almirante's dedication to every aspect of his collection warranted the highest praise not only from his Spanish contemporaries, but also from foreign visitors. After touring several collections in Madrid, the Imperial Ambassador Ferdinand Harrach noted in his diary entry of 16 May 1674 that the collection of the 10th almirante was one of the best he had seen and that it could even be considered equal to that of Prince Leopold Wilhelm (Graf F.B. Harrach, Tagebuch...1673-74, F. Mencik, ed., Vienna 1913, p. 91). The 1691 inventory of the 10th almirante's collection was taken upon orders from the Crown with the intention of auctioning it in order to pay off his heavy debts. Although the inventory was completed, the sale never took place, and the collection was inherited by his son, Juan Tomás, the 11th Almirante de Castilla. When the War of Spanish Succession broke out in 1702, Juan Tomás went to Lisbon to join forces against the Bourbons, leaving behind most of his possessions. At this point, the collection that had been in the family for more than seventy years was confiscated by the state and later dispersed. The inventory was taken from 25 September 1691, the day of the owner's death, to 21 October 1691, (legajo 498-3, ff. 3-168) by his sons, Don Juan Thomas Enríquez de Cabrera, the successor, and Don Luis Enríquez de Cabrera, Marqués de Alcañizas. The paintings were appraised by Claudio Coello, beginning on 19 November 1691. Coello follows the detailed descriptions of the inventory but offers few attributions. Folios 337-38 provide a tasación del Jardín; ff. 376-93 contain an evaluation of the statues. The tapestries are appraised among the fine textiles (ff. 242-97).","Collectors Files:  Castilla, Almirante de","input"

Tasación of the paintings of Don Sebastián de Cottes y la Carcel, on the basis of an inventory taken beginning 30 January 1703, in anticipation of an almoneda.  The tasador was Francisco de Leonardoni, Pintor de su Magd, and the main beneficiary was Don García Manuel de Cottes [who signed himself de Cottes y Morelos but who is also called de Cottes y la Carcel -- probably a scribal error -- in the documents].  Don García Manuel is described as the heredero of the deceased.  The executors and witnesses were hidalgos (Don...) and were court functionaries or members of royal councils. The collection of Don Sebastián de Cottes y la Carcel was probably one of the last middle-class art collections formed in Hapsburg Spain.  A courtier, a member of the Council of Castile, and part of a group of highly placed middle-class royal officials in the first years of the new Bourbon dynasty, Cottes had collected some 85 pictures by the time of his death in early 1703.  These included both Italian and Flemish pictures, with particular emphasis on the Neapolitan school in artists such as Ribera and Andrea Vaccaro.  The explanation of this interest may be found in the eight works attributed to Luca Giordano, who had left Spain to return to his native Italy in 1702.  Among the works attributed to Giordano are a Perseus with the Head of Medusa and a full-length Portrait of King Charles II.  Since the inventory was taken so soon after Giordano's departure, we may assume that the works were either acquired directly from the artist in the course of his activities in Madrid and at the Escorial, from the artist at the time of his departure, or from court sources very close to the artist.  In any case, the inventory suggests that Giordano, in addition to his work for the crown, cultivated other patrons or markets, perhaps due to the interregnum brought about by the death of Charles II.'","Don Sebastián de Cotes y de la Cárcel was a revered legal expert and was consequently called upon to draw up King Carlos II's will.

Documents for the History of Collecting: Spanish Inventories 1, Collections of Paintings in Madrid 1601-1755 (Los Angeles: Getty, 1997), pp.572-578.","","","","Burke writes:  'Inventory, valuation, and partition of the estate of Don Francisco de Oviedo, late secretary to the King and Gentleman of the King's Chamber, executor of the will of the Most Eminent Lord Don Bernardo de Sandoval y Rojas, Cardinal Archbishop of Toledo (deceased) ... legitimate son of the Señores Luis de Oviedo, Contador mayor to His Eminence, and of his wife, Doña Beatriz de Espinoza (fol. 178);  Don Francisco died 21 February 1663.  Tapestries were inventoried fol. 5, with five panels de la Gentilidad and a six-panelled History of Scipio.  The paintings were inventoried 26 February 1663 (fols. 10-13, 150-53) with 69 lots numbered 55-123, and were appraised 26 September 1663 by Luis Fernández, maestro pintor and a vecino de Madrid (fols. 24-31). Certain of the pictures were entailed for inheritance by the eldest son.  The valuations were repeated in the cuerpo de hacienda (fols. 208-218), with annotations in the margins giving the specified heir (see above, beneficiaries);  the cuerpo (partition) document is photocopied in the Collectors Files.  Some of the items in the inventory provide attributions not repeated in the cuerpo.  The entailed pictures are specified on fols. 427v-430v, in the hijuela (inheritance portion) of Don Luis, the eldest son.  The presence of entailed items is curious in a non-noble collection with a patronazgo (as opposed to a mayorazgo).  A is obvious from many of the entries, large portions of the collection in fact came from the collection of Don Bernardo de Sandoval y Rojas, Cardinal Archbishop of Toledo in the time of the Duque de Lerma, as discussed at length by Burke 1984, vol. 1, Chapter One, and in the Getty PI publication. Abbrieviations used for beneficiaries in Partition:  A for Ana, widow; L for Luis, eldest son; f or fr for Francisco; and B for Bernarda.","As has been suggested in the Introduction, the collection of Don Francisco de Oviedo (1663), in addition to being of interest in its own right, documents the much earlier collection of Don Bernardo de Sandoval y Rojas, Cardinal Archbishop of Toledo in the time of the Duque de Lerma. (Lerma was Cardinal Sandoval's nephew; the Cardinal was Archbishop from 1599 and died 7 December 1618.) A provenance from the collection of Sandoval y Rojas is obvious from many of the entries (nos. 96, 141, 266 ff.). The presence of numerous still lifes accords with Philip's having bought this type of painting from the Archbishop's estate (see Introduction). Almost every artist mentioned in the documents was a member of the generation working under Philip III, and the exceptions are either older artists or, as in the case of Guido Reni and Ribera, artists whose careers were just beginning around 1610. The collection presumably passed to the Oviedo family through the intervention of the Cardinal's contador mayor, Don Luis de Oviedo. The collection was subsequently owned by Don Luis's son, Don Luis González de Oviedo, and then by a second son, Don Francisco de Oviedo, in whose estate the pictures were inventoried and appraised. Both brothers had been in the Cardinal's service along with their parents. The Cardinal had also endowed their mother, the contador's widow, with an annuity for life. The presence of entailed items is curious -- indeed, unprecedented -- in a non-noble collection with a patronazgo (as opposed to a mayorazgo). In addition to the works by Reni and Ribera, the tenebrist school is represented by a Madonna with Pilgrims attributed to Caravaggio (no. 1 in the valuation). This picture may be the canvas which now hangs in the Museo Lázaro Galdiano in Madrid -- an excellent copy of the famous Madonna of Loreto that Caravaggio painted for the Church of San Agostino in Rome around 1604. (Pérez Sánchez, in Seville 1973, p. 4-5, no. 5. The years 1613-14 seem particularly important for the arrival of Caravaggesque works in Spain. The 1647 inventory of the collection of the Almirante de Castilla also includes a similarly described work. It is impossible to say with certainty whether the two pictures were identical or whether they were independent copies of Caravaggio's original. The most likely (but by no means certain) conclusion is that there were in fact two copies and that the Oviedo picture had originally been a part of the collection of the Cardinal Sandoval y Rojas. If so, then there is circumstantial evidence of yet another close copy of Caravaggio in Spain within a decade of the artist's death.) There were also works attributed to Saraceni (Carlos beneciano; nos. 4, 8, 9, 11, 14 (copy), 32, 39) and Guido Reni (no. 34, 37) in the Oviedo collection. (Of the paintings attributed to Reni in the 1663 inventory, only the first three attributions were accepted at the subsequent valuation. See the Oviedo documents, lot numbers as noted above in the text.) Saraceni is known to have sent three paintings to the Toledo Cathedral Chapter during the Archbishop's tenure. (Pérez Sánchez, Carlo Saraceni à la Cathedrale de Tolede, in Actes du XXIIeme Congrès International d'Histoire de l'Art, vol. 2, Budapest 1970, pp. 25-28; documents published by the Marques de Saltillo, Efemerides artisticas madrilenas, in Boletín de la Real Academia de la Historia vol. 120, 1947, p. 610. Cf. Seville 1973, nos. 31-33. The Judith in the Oviedo lists may be the good copy that Pérez Sánchez recorded on the Madrid art market in 1963 -- see his Pintura italiana del siglo XVII en España, Madrid 1965, p. 567.) The relatively large number of extant or documented copies, school pieces, and originals by Reni in Spanish collections today -- not to mention the uncertainty with which the Oviedo documents attribute works to this artist -- make identification difficult. The Immaculate Conception, now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York (no. 59.32), is perhaps the most famous of Reni's commissions for Spanish patrons. Friedlaender 1965, p. 57 and note 6, speculates that it was influential in developing the seventeenth-century Spanish formula for this subject in Spain. H. Hibbard, on the other hand, finds that Reni's Immaculata was sent to Spain, where it seems to have aroused little comment. See Hibbard's article in the Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, vol. 28, 1969, pp. 21-22. Pérez Sánchez 1965, pp. 168ff., lists 32 extant or documented works by Reni in Spain, as well as a large number of school pieces, copies, lost works, and other works described as badly attributed to Reni. I have not been able to identify any of these with the Oviedo/Sandoval y Rojas pieces. The Oviedo collection was equally rich in works by Spanish painters active in the first wave of tenebrist naturalism. The largest group of these Spanish works consists of approximately nine paintings by the Toledan artist Luis Tristán, a pupil of El Greco who quickly adopted the new chiaroscuro manner (nos. 9, 16, 17, 35, 36, 44). (Angulo and Pérez Sánchez, Historia de la pintura española, vol. 2, Escuela toledana..., Madrid 1972, pp. 113ff. It is difficult to identify extant works by Tristán with any of the paintings mentioned in the Oviedo lists. The catalogue of Tristán's works in Angulo/Pérez Sánchez, vol. 2, 1972, offers no parallels for the secular works in the inventories. The St. Sebastian, no. 21 in the valuation, might refer to the canvas of the same subject in the Toledo Cathedral (Angulo/Pérez Sánchez, vol. 2, 1972, p. 188, no. 220, pl. 188; the work is signed), but the Toledo work has only four arrows, while the valuation specifies five. Perhaps one was lost when the painting was cut down -- if it was cut down -- to the present three-quarter-length format. The entry most likely to find identification is no. 54, a Self-portrait. The so-called Self-portrait of Borgianni in the Prado (no. 877), which has been variously given to Mazo and to March, has also been attributed to Tristán as well. The authorship of this work is at best disputed; it is still the subject of much scholarly discussion. See Angulo/Pérez Sánchez, vol. 2, 1972, p. 191, and especially, R.E. Spear, Caravaggio and his Followers, rev. ed., New York 1975, no. 8, pp. 56-57, and Appendix (Spear's), p. 227. A proposed Self-portrait of Tristán was on the Paris art market in 1928; its attribution was tentatively accepted by Angulo and Pérez Sánchez, vol. 2, 1972, p. 191, no. 231, pl. 156.)  Tristán is known to have painted the posthumous likeness of Cardinal Sandoval y Rojas (documented to 1619) that still hangs in the gallery of archepiscopal portraits in the Sala Capitular of the Toledo Cathedral (Ibid. , pp. 194-95, pl. 95. See J. Brown and D. A. Carr, in Studies in the History of Art, vol. 2, Washington 1982, pp. 32-42, for an extended discussion of portraits and possible portraits of Cardinal Sandoval y Rojas). A second contemporary Spanish tenebrist, Juan Sánchez Cotán, was represented in the collection by four still lifes -- all copies (nos. 31, 51). The fact that these works are copies is not without significance, because it gives an idea of the popularity that Cotán's secular works had attained after his entrance into the Carthusian order in 1604. (J. Cavestany, Floreros y bodegones en la pintura española (exhibition catalogue), Madrid 1936-40, p. 137, publishes Cotán's 1603 inventory, taken before he entered into the order in 1604. This includes mentions of replicas and, in one case, of a Cotán canvas that served as the model for copies. See also Angulo/Pérez Sánchez II, 1972, p. 62.) Two of the paintings attributed to Cotán are described as landscapes. Although no such works by Cotán are known to be extant, a paisillo pequeño was recorded in his inventory of 1603 (Cavestany, p. 138; Angulo/Pérez Sánchez II, 1972, p. 95, no. 194). Pais might also refer to a landscape format (horizontal). Cotán's teacher, Blas del Prado, was also included in the Oviedo collection (no. 23), as was the earlier master, Morales (nos. 107). The court circles were represented, as already noted, by the gentleman-painter and collector, Don Juan de Jaureguí, as well as Vicencio Carducho and Eugenio Caxés, who were active as a team at the Toledo Cathedral in 1614. Works by northern artists are also found in the collection. In addition to a work by Frans Floris (no. 63) and a copy after Dürer (no. 38), there were Flemish landscapes, flower pieces, and still lifes. One miscellaneous item, a monumental View of Venice, is of interest as the most highly valued painting in the collection. It could have been Italian, although it might possibly have been done by a Fleming or even a Spaniard working after prints, such as Jacopo de' Barbari's famous woodcut map of 1497-1500. Since El Greco was also painting cityscapes and topographical views at about the time the Archbishop was assembling his collection, there may have been a local interest in this genre (See, for example, the View and Plan of Toledo in the Museo del Greco, Toledo). The inventory, valuation, and partition of the estate of Don Francisco legitimate son of the Señores Luis de Oviedo, Contador mayor to His Eminence, and of his wife, Doña Beatriz de Espinoza (f. 178), were made following his death 21 February 1663. (This document has been published previously by Barrio Moya (1979, pp. 163-71), who gives a useful summary of the biography of Don Francisco de Oviedo (most of it from the document) but does not suggest a provenance to the collection of Cardinal Sandoval y Rojas.) Tapestries were inventoried on f. 5, with five panels de la Gentilidad and a six-panelled History of Scipio. The paintings were inventoried 26 February 1663 (ff. 10-13, 150-53) with 69 lots numbered 55-123, and were appraised 26 September 1663 by Luis Fernández, who is styled maestro pintor and a vecino de Madrid (ff. 24-31). Certain of the pictures were entailed for inheritance by the eldest son. The entailed pictures are specified on ff. 427v-430v, in the hijuela (inheritance portion) of Don Luis, the eldest son. Published here is the cuerpo de hacienda (ff. 208-219v).","Collectors Files","input"

In 1653 the death of this wife, Francisca Velázquez, prompted an inventory and valuation of Mazo's studio.  Velázquez was not involved.  However, Angelo Nardi, Benito Manuel Aguero and Juan de Pareja are mentioned in the documents.  The inventory records religious paintings, an unknown aspect of Mazo's production.  A number of inventoried paintings can be identified as small-scale copies by Mazo, primarily after paintings by Titian and Rubens.  Two of these are probably the Diana and Acteon and Diana and Calisto in the Prado. Two versions of Mazo's famous View of Zaragoza were listed, but were apparently smaller than the Prado painting.  A small View of Pamplona in the inventory is probably a painting now in Apsley House, London.","","Collectors Files:  Mazo, Juan Bautista Martínez del","not input"

On his death, his estate was partitioned between his children Juana García de la Madriz, Marquesa de Portago, and Andrés Saturnino Gómez de Teran. The lengthy document was finished and signed on 1 October 1755. The Marquesa de Portago inherited the entire collection of paintings listed in the cuerpo de hacienda.  The most notable aspect of this collection inventory is the presence of attributed paintings from the minor genres. It included, for instance, a pair of battles by Micco Spadaro (no. 34), and eighteen battle paintings by Jacques Courtois (nos. 7, 8, 33, 43, 44, 53, 54, 62). There were examples of seascapes attributed to Jan Brueghel (nos. 21, 63), a flowerpiece (no. 39) and a group of four landscapes attributed generically to one of the Brueghels (no. 45). There were also Italian still lifes (no. 55) and ten works specified as of the Roman school (nos. 5, 32, 49, 61), as well as eight flowerpieces by Mario Nuzzi (nos. 22, 23, 25) and two flowerpieces on slate by an artist listed only by her nickname, La Milanesa (no. 47). Spanish still life and flower painters were also represented; there were four flowerpieces by Bartolomé Pérez (nos. 13, 38) and still lifes by Antonio de Pereda (nos. 26, 30) and that most elusive and sought-after artist Juan Fernández El Labrador (nos. 20, 37). One of his paintings painted on panel depicted nuts and hazelnuts. However, the most highly valued Spanish paintings were two devotional images which appear at the head of the list, a Christ Carrying the Cross by Luis de Morales (no. 1) and a painting of the Virgin by Murillo (no. 2), which may have been hung as pendants.","Collectors Files:  Portago, Joseph Gómez de Terán, Marqués de","input"

Montesclaros' second wife (also his niece) was Doña Luisa Antonia Fernández Portocarrero, the widow of Don Rodrigo Mesía Carillo de Fonseca, fourth Marqués de la Guardia.  The post-mortem inventory, begun on 9th October 1628 at his houses in the Plazuela de Matute, is AHPM, Prot. 6172, fols.220-327.  The picture collection and oratory (fols.232v-245; and 247) were inventoried from 19th to 23rd October 1628.  The appraisal of the estate, begun on 16th October 1628, is on fols.329-458.  The pictures were valued by the painters Vicente Carducho and Antonio de Monrreal on 28th and 30th November 1628 (fols.424-41v) and the disposal of the estate by public auction (almoneda) began on 17th November 1628 (fols.460-606).  Finally, a detailed set of accounts submitted by the widow were approved in April 1633 (fols.618-91v).  We have only the paintings sections of the inventory and valuation. Acc. to Garcia Caraffa: Montesclaros's first wife was Ana Mesía de Mendoza y Aragón, daughter of Rodgrigo Mesía Carrillo, II Marqués of Guardia and his wife Isabel de Mendoza y Mendoza; Ana was the sister of the V Duque del Infantado.  Montesclaros's second wife was Luisa Antonia Portocarrero y Mendoza, his niece, daughter of his sister Francisca, the Condesa de Palma.  Luisa was married first to IV Marqués de la Guardia, Rodrigo.","Don Juan Manuel de Mendoza y Luna, 3rd Marqués de Montesclaros, Marqués de Castil de Bayela (1571-1628) was a member of the Mendoza family, headed by the Duques del Infantado, whose principal seat was at Guadalajara. (See P. Cherry, New documents for Velázquez in the 1620s, The Burlington Magazine (February 1991), pp. 108-115.) In 1600 he was made asistente of Seville, was Viceroy of Mexico between 1603-1607, when the Sevillian artist Alonso Vázquez traveled in his entourage, and Viceroy of Peru 1607-1616. Montesclaros rose to prominence and influence in the early years of the reign of Philip IV, protected by the Conde-Duque de Olivares, appointed to the Councils of State and War, President of the Council of Finance (Hacienda y Contaduría) between 1623-1626, as well as President of the Council of Aragón, and enjoying the title of gentilhombre de la cámara del Rey. The postmortem inventory of the estate of the Marqués de Montesclaros was begun in Madrid in his houses on the Plazuela de Matute on 9 October 1628 (AHPM, Prot. 6172, ff. 220-327), including his large library, picture collection and oratory inventoried between 19-23 October (AHPM, Prot. 6.172, ff. 232v-245, 247). Montesclaros had probably formed his collection after his return to Spain in 1616; it was appraised for sale between 28-30 November 1628 by the establishment painters Vicencio Carducho and Antonio de Monrreal, who did not attribute any of the works they saw (AHPM, Prot. 6.172, ff. 424-441v). The disposal of Montesclaros' moveable goods by public auction began on 17 November (ff. 460-606), and attracted noble and common purchasers alike. Among these were the Marqués de Oropesa (who bought nos. 9, 11, 12), Don Antonio de Moscoso (nos. 17, 22, 40, 41, 44-50, 57, 58, 60, 61). One of the most distinguished collectors of paintings who bought at the sale was the Duque de Medina de las Torres, who acquired six paintings (nos. 1, 3, 4, 7, 35), although these were not listed in his postmortem inventory of 1668 and had perhaps been sold or given away in his lifetime (Burke 1989). The connoisseur and amateur painter praised by Carducho in 1633, Jerónimo de Villafuerte, Guardajoyas of the king, bought a painting by the Bassani (no. 14) (Carducho, ed. 1979, pp. 422-423). The Marqués de Montesclaros has earned a special place in history of Spanish painting as one of the private patrons of Velázquez during his early years at court, from whom he commissioned a portrait of the Conde-Duque de Olivares, miniatures of Olivares and Philip IV for a venera pendant, and portraits of himself and his wife (Cherry 1991). The inventory and valuation list the full-length portrait of Olivares (no. 63), and another smaller painting (no. 64), that of the Marquesa (no. 76), and two of Montesclaros himself, an unframed full-length and a framed half-length (no. 75), which, at this time, were still unfinished. In the mid-1620s, a combination of ambition and financial embarrassment moved Montesclaros into the Olivares camp and by 1626 he had become one of the most fervent supporters of the Conde-Duque and his policies (Elliott 1986, pp. 73, 273). The commission of portraits of Olivares from Velázquez would have flattered his protector and was a gesture of political allegiance, since loyal ministers were expected to own official portraits of the king, the royal family, and his favorite. Montesclaros' collection of state portraits included full-lengths of the Duque de Uceda, the previous válido between 1618-21, and his wife, as well as a set of 23 dynastic portraits of the Habsburg royal family. While Velázquez and his studio enjoyed a monopoly in respect to portraits of Philip IV, and possibly of Olivares too, sets of images of Habsburg royals, so common in courtly collections, were the specialty of the royal portraitist Bartolomé González. Some 205 paintings were listed in Montesclaros' collection. The appraisal distinguished profane subject matter from religious paintings, called Pinturas de devoción (no. 80ff). Some of the latter were undoubtedly gallery pictures that had probably hung in the main rooms of the house, while others were from the oratory (nos. 98-111). The accounts of Montesclaros' estate mention a payment of 4,216 reales to Carducho for paintings of angels, which the marqués gave to his daughter, the Duquesa del Infantado (Cherry 1991, p. 112, no. 35). Unfortunately, however, the only attributed pictures in Montesclaros' collection were four paintings of the Story of Noah by the Bassani (no. 14). Cassiano dal Pozzo visited the Montesclaros palace while at Madrid with the papal legation in 1626 and, although he remarked on the large number of paintings, he mentioned the subjects of only three, one of which was a painting of the famous Spanish victory over the Dutch at Bahía de Todos los Santos in Brazil in 1625 (See J. Simón-Díaz, El arte en las mansiones nobiliarias madrileñas de 1626, Goya 154 [1980], p. 203). This much-celebrated victory was depicted by Juan Bautista Mayno in a painting in the Salón de los Reinos of the Buen Retiro, Prado and the subject was an appropriate painting for a former South-American viceroy and militant Councilor of State who had vociferously supported a tax to pay for the Spanish fleet whose home port was at Bahía. This was not listed in Montesclaros' inventory, although paintings of natives (nos. 70, 77) and the port of Callão in Peru (no. 78) reflected his years of foreign service in the Indies. There was also a painting of the native king of the island of Ternate (no. 69), one of the vital spice-producing Indonesian Islas Molucas, occupied by Spain in 1606. The other paintings noticed by Cassiano in the Montesclaros palace were a pair of Flemish still lifes bought from the auction of the celebrated collection of Don Rodrigo de Calderón. Large, flamboyant Flemish still lifes by Frans Snyders enjoyed great popularity among Spanish noble collectors, and the pair that excited Cassiano's admiration were in fact the centerpiece of Montesclaros' collection. At 7,700 reales, these were the most highly valued paintings in the appraisal of Vicencio Carducho (no. 8). While Carducho was an artist and theoretician who regarded still life as a minor genre of painting, he must also have been well aware of the esteem and value of such works on the Spanish market and assigned them a high value. They were the most expensive paintings sold at Montesclaros' estate auction, where they were acquired by the Genoese merchant-banker Pablo Justiniano for 5,500 reales. Since the pictures were not listed in Justiniano's own postmortem inventory of 1634 (Doc. 19), they may have been sold on or possibly shipped back to Genoa before his death. Justiniano's inventory, however, does allow us to attribute two anonymous paintings from Montesclaros' collection to a specific artist. On 24 March 1629, Justiniano bought two large paintings (210 x 336 cm.) depicting the Burning of Troy with the Trojan Horse and the Banquet of Dido and Aeneas (nos. 5, 6) for 1,000 and 1,400 reales, respectively. In his postmortem inventory of 1634, these pictures were inventoried as by Juan de la Corte, the latter painting being called a Banquet of Anthony and Cleopatra (see Doc. 19, nos. 27, 28). Montesclaros owned another version of this subject, painted on panel and paired with a Feast of Belshazzar (no. 18). The inventory and valuation give no clues as to the authorship of these, nor Montesclaros' other valuable mythological paintings (nos. 3, 4, 20, 34, 35). A change in the entry suggests that the painting of the story of Actaeon (no. 3) actually represented Marsyas. The large painting of Hercules fighting with the Nemean lion (no. 34) is an interesting precedent in a court collection for Francisco de Zurbarán's Hercules series of 1634 for the Salón de los Reinos. This painting was sold to Pablo Justiniano for 1.100 reales and was listed in his inventory in 1634 (Doc. 19, no. 29). Montesclaros owned two paintings with female nudes, a Lucretia (no. 17) and an unspecified fable (no. 20) that seems to represent the theme of Sacred and Profane Love.","Collectors Files:  Montesclaros, Marqués de","input"

Still Life and Genre in Spain, Ph.d. diss. Courtauld Institute of Art, 1991, pp.128-135.","","","","A Flemish artistocrat in Madrid, Jean de Croy, II Comte de Solre and Baron de Molembais (d.1638) can be tentatively identified as one of Van der Hamen's most important and distinguished patrons.  Solre inherited court favour, political status and Spanish connections from his father Philippe de Croy, I Comte de Solre (d.1612), a prominent minister and diplomatic envy of the Spanish Regents of the Netherlands.  He went to Madrid in 1624 with recommendations from the Archduchess Isabella, was made a gentleman of the King's Chamber and in 1628 appointed to the Council of Flanders, becoming an important intermediary between Madrid and Brussels.  PC suggests in his diss. that a full-length portrait by Van der Hamen of a Knight of the Golden Fleece with a commander's baton, signed and dated 1626 (Pl.34), represents Solre as captain of the Guard of the Archers.  In the year it was painted, Solre was sent to Poland on military negotiations and the portrait might also be associated with the mission.  It comes from a series by different hands representing members of the Peralta family and is inscribed with the name of a 16th century nobleman, Don Gastón de Peralta, III Marqués de Falces. Although it cannot represent this individual, the surname may provide a clue to the sitter's real identity, since the Marqués de Falces at the time was D. Diego de Croy y Peralta.  Like his forbears, Falces was captain of the Flemish Guard of Archers of which Van der Hamen was a member.  Unlike the sitter in Van der Hamen's portrait, Falces was not a knight of the Golden Fleece.  However, in 1614 Philip III had conferred this honour on Falces' nephew, Jean de Croy, II Comte de Solre. The choice of Van der Hamen, one of Solre's own men, for his portrait would have been natural.  Van der Hamen's Flemish name and background may also have been a factor in attracting his attention.  Solre belonged to a circle of distringuished collectors in Madrid who shared an admiration for Flemish art, headed by the King, the Marqués de Leganés and Philippe-Charles, Prince-comte d'Aremberg, Ducd'Aerschott (in Madrid 1633-40).  On his death in Madrid in 1638, an inventory was drawn up by his Flemish executors, the most senior of whom was D. Carlos de Boniers, Baron de Auchi, of the contents of Solre's house on the fashionable calle de Alcalá.  His collection of some 150 valuable paintings of mostly profane, decorative subjects was appraised by Felix Castello, an artist of Italian extraction, and Felipe Diriksen, a member of Solre's Guard of Archers, and described as pintores de mucha opinion en esta corte.  The choice of an Italian and a Fleming to value the paintings might imply a mistrust of Spanish painters' knowledge and appreciation of foreign art. No portrait of Solre was listed in the collection.  Apart from two works after Rubens, none of the pictures were attributed.  However, their subject matter and supports - some on panel, copper and stone - strongly suggest that the majority came from Solre's native Flanders. It would appear that at some time after his arrival in Madrid in 1624 Solre commissioned from Van der Hamen the recently rediscovered pair of unsigned trompe l'oiel still lifes with vases of flowers and dogs, now in the Prado.  Two paintings which might be identifiable with these were inventoried hanging on the door in the third room of Solre's house, which led on to his Galeria Mayor or picture gallery, discussed below:  otros dos payses a lo largo de una puerta Con dos Ramillerteros arriva y dos perros abajo sin marcos.  In the collection valuation they were more explicitly described as dos quadros donde estan Unos Ramilleteros de flores de flandes y unos vidros y dulces con unos Perros.  The paintings were unframed and their dimensions given as 252 x 112 cm., which roughly corresponds with the size of the Van der Hamen pictures now in the Prado (228 x 95 cm).  Valued at thirty ducats each (330 reales), they were bought from Solre's auction by the King and could be the same paintings which later hung in the dining room of the Madrid Alcázar and which were also thought Flemish. In the latter part of his career Van der Hamen may have enjoyed a reputation for illusionistic decoration and trompe l'oeil; Solre's commission can perhaps be related to the three pictures with unas pilastres y figuras grandes Van der Hamen painted for the gallery of the Infante-Cardinal in 1630.  In the Prado pair, Van der Hamen certainly displayed the full range of his talent in still life for one of his most appreciative patrons.  Solre may have particularly requested such a demonstration of Van der Hamen's skill in flower painting, an idiom associated with Flanders and appropriate for a patron who may also have owned his Offering to Flora, discussed below.  Van der Hamen's magnificent arrangements of flowers dwarf his other bouquets, and are much richer in blooms.  Significantly perhaps, tulips are particularly prominent in one picture. Some of the elements in these unusual illusionistic still lifes were a familiar part of Van der Hamen's repertory in pictures aimed at distinguished clients.  The striking ormolu vases are related to blue-glass and gilt objets d'art in other still lifes.  Sweets and candied fruit were Van der Hamen's trademark; the motif of two boxes of sweets and a jar of cherries perched on one of the sidetables made an early appearance in Van der Hamen's oeuvre and was re-used throughout his career.  Solre's paintings are related to the serving table or aparador still life type which Van der Hamen sometimes painted.  Unframed, they apparently disguised a doorway, hanging the length of a door, perhaps set into the panels of a double door.  This being the case, their illusionism is most effective when hung together with a central vanishing point, as in Plate 46.  They complement Solrey's lifestyle quite literally, and with another twist to the tale of Zeuxis' grapes, in these life-sized still lifes it is the viewer who is deceived, reaches out to sample the sweetmeats, leans forward to catch the scent of the bouquets.  The clock shows almost five, perhaps time for a merienda of sweets and chilled wine. The pictures' illusionism may have been sharpened even further if some of the represented objects were actually taken from life.  The dog and its puppy, possibly Solre's pets, could have personalized the pictures.  Van der Hamen painted animals and Solre had a portrait of a dog in his collecion; he may have been portrayed with a favourite dalmation in Van der Hamen's portrait of 1626.  There was a mirror in the room where the paintings hung and attachments on the walls for bouquets of flowers.  Perhaps the wood and tile floor and serving tables covered with green damask reflected the decor of Solre's house.  The elegant gilt clock is an unusual element in Van der Hamen's still life repertory and may have been Solre's own. The room in which Van der Hamen's illusionistic still lifes hung was dominated by a pair of a large, unframed Flemish kitchen still lifes (quadros grandes de concinas uno de diferentes carnes y otro de pescados), along with associated paintings of fowl hunts, a picture of different birds and landscapes.  The Flemish still lifes were worth 13.000 reales, which made them the most valuable pictures in Solre's collecion, and were both acquired by the King.  The fish painting was the more expensive of the pair (7000 reales) and the other depicted a despensa of fowl with a swan (6000 reales), recalling works by an artist such as Frans Snyders.  The differences between Van der Hamen's still lifes and these large Flemish pictures was underscored by their relative values, Van der Hamen's pair worth a comparatively modest 660 reales. Precisely at the time when the English ambassador, Sir Arthur Hopton, remarked on the quantity and quality of Philip IV's acquisision of paintings, he is documented buying works of art from Solre's estate auction.  The King acquired twenty eight of Solre's paintings; a religious subject, sixteen quality landscapes, an expensive pair of hunting scenes and nine of the genre and still life pictures.  Theses included some of the best of Solre's genre and still life paintings, such as his pair of Flemish pictures of fish and fowl, a picture of a despensa de caça with a monkey overturning a basket as well as a festoon of fruit and flowers with putti.  Such pictures had exemplified Philip's taste for Flemish painting in his decoration of the summer apartments of the Madrid Alcázar, discussed above. In fact one large gallery of Solre's palace, the galeria Mayor, recalled Philip's summer dining room and was hung with some thirty-six paintings loosely associated with the theme of nature, which included landscapes, hunting scenes, still lifes and genre.  A showpiece of the gallery was large copper of a Banquet of the Gods with small figures, which was probably Flemish.  There was perhaps a thematic link between this and three larger paintings with goddesses, fruit and flowers, two of which might have been Van der Hamen's Pomona and Vertumnus (229 x 149 cm) of 1626 and his Offering to Flora (216 x 140 cm) of 1627. Unfortunately, the inventory descriptions are so cursory as to make any such identification extremely uncertain.  The pictures were called tres pinturas con sus marcos de pino de negro, una de fructas con una figura de dama.  otra de Rayces y otra de flores cada una ... de dos varas de alto y vara y media de ancho, some 168 x 126 cm.  The three were separated into a pair (worth 2400 reales) and a single painting (1700 reales) in the valuaiton of Solre's collection; dos quadros de dos diosas una de flores, y otro de fructas que tienen de cayda tres varas poco mas o menos y de ancho dos Varas menos sesma poco mas o menos ... otro quadro del tamaño de Los dhos tanbien de una diossa con un canastill de fructas en la mano.  Their dimensions were slightly larger in the latter entry, some 252 x 150 cm, closer in size to Van der Hamen's pictures.  However, it is also possible that Solrey's paintings are identifiable with three pastiches comprising elements from Van der Hamen and Rubens painted in Madrid in the 1630s, allegories of Spring, Summer and Autumn which were listed in the collection of the Marqués de Leganés in 1655.  ***Also see our cat. Een Stad en een Geslacht Leuven and Croy - over Alicia's desk - Croy was related to Arenberg","The Flemish aristocrat resident at the Spanish court, Jean de Croy, 2nd Comte de Solre and Baron de Molembais (d. 1638), inherited court favor, political status, and Spanish connections from his father Philippe de Croy, 1st Comte de Solre (d. 1612), a prominent minister and diplomatic envoy of the Spanish Regents of the Netherlands (See Biographie Nationale...de Belgique (Brussels, 1921-24), t. 23, s.v. Croy, Jean de, by V. Brants, pp. 121-126; Biographie Nationale de Belgique, Supplément (Brussels, 1959), vol. 2, pp. 303-306). Solre first went to Madrid in 1613 and received the Order of the Golden Fleece from Philip III in 1614. In Madrid in 1624, with recommendations from the Archduchess Isabella, Solre was sworn into the Consejo de Estado and was made a gentleman of the King's Chamber (Gentilhombre de la cámara de Su Majestad). Philip IV had a high opinion of his diplomatic abilities, and he was sent on missions to France, Poland, Germany, and the Netherlands. In 1628 Solre was appointed to the newly reformed and augmented Council of Flanders (Consejo de Flandes), becoming an important intermediary between Madrid and Brussels. Solre had been captain of the guard of the Archduke Albert, and in Madrid was made captain of the Flemish royal guard of Archers on 5 May 1624, remaining in this post until his death in 1638. On his death in Madrid in 1638, an inventory of Solre's possessions at court was drawn up by his mayordomo Lorenzo del Campo and his Flemish executors, the most senior of whom was Charles de Bonnieres, Baron de Auchy. (See Solre's codicil of 13 July 1635, opened on his death on 9 May 1638, AHPM, Prot. 5.327, ff. 202-210v.) The contents of nine rooms of Solre's house on the calle de Alcalá and his huerta were inventoried, although the function of these rooms was not specified. There was a large and small gallery, two piezas de retrete and the Camarín, in which Solre had hung many of his pictures on copper and best paintings (i.e., nos. 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 22, 69). Appropriately, Solre had decorated a building in his orchard garden (huerta) with nature paintings, including landscapes, still lifes, and animal pictures (nos. 76-80). Solre's collection of some 151 valuable paintings that hung throughout the house were the first items of furniture to be inventoried in each of the rooms visited. Remarkably, only six of the paintings were religious subjects; the vast majority were of profane or decorative subjects, which including as many as 82 landscapes. The collection was appraised on 19 May 1638 by Felix Castello (ca.1595-1651), an artist of Italian extraction, and Felipe Diriksen (1590-1679), a member of Solre's Guard of Archers, whom the document described as pintores de mucha opinion en esta corte. Solre's collection of sculptures and bronzes was appraised on 14 July 1638. Solre's executors decided to sell his goods in Madrid as soon as possible, thereby avoiding the costs and risks of storing them until his Flemish heirs came to court, and also avoiding the costs of transporting the estate to Flanders (AHPM, Prot. 5.328, ff. 125v-127.) The auction of Solre's effects began on 1 July 1638, and attracted many non-noble collectors. Given the numbers of Flemish pictures that were probably on sale, the Marqués de Leganés was conspicuous by his absence. At the time, he was Governor of Milan and was perhaps away from the court. On 3 July, Don Luis de Haro bought two bronze figures of Hercules from the collection. Marginal annotations in the appraisal document correspond to numbered lots in the sale document. In our transcription, however, only those annotations denoting pictures reserved for Solre's estate (en ser) and those works acquired by Philip IV (su mag.d le tiene) have been retained. The choice of an Italian and a Flemish artist to value the paintings might imply a mistrust of Spanish painters' knowledge and appreciation of foreign art. Apart from two religious subjects after Rubens (nos. 23, 24), none of the pictures was attributed. However, their subject matter and supports -- some on panel, copper and stone -- suggests that many came from Solre's native Flanders. One of Solre's paintings of Moses and the Brazen Serpent (no. 1) was owned by Don Francisco de Moncada, Marqués de Aytona, the Spanish ambassador in Flanders, and was worth the large sum of 3,000 reales. Evidently a painting by an important artist, this measured some 168 x 231 cm. and might be identifiable with the early painting by Van Dyck of this subject and with similar dimensions (205 x 235 cm.) now in the Prado, which was first inventoried in the Madrid Alcázar in 1666 (See M. Díaz Padrón, Museo del Prado. Escuela Flamenca del siglo XVII, Madrid, 1975, I, pp. 118-119). Solre can be identified as one of the most important and distinguished patrons of Juan van der Hamen. Van der Hamen's Flemish name and background may have been a factor in attracting his attention, as was the fact that the artist was one of Solre's own men in the royal guard of Flemish Archers. At some time after his arrival in Madrid in 1624 Solre commissioned from Van der Hamen the recently rediscovered pair of unsigned trompe l'oeil still lifes with vases of flowers and dogs, now in the Prado (Figs. 29 and 30; M. Orihuela Maeso, Dos obras inéditas de Van der Hamen depositadas en la Embajada de Buenos Aires, Boletín del Museo del Prado, 3, 1982, pp. 11-14). Two paintings that must be identifiable with these were inventoried hanging unframed on the door in the third room of Solre's house, whose function was unspecified but which led on to his Galeria Mayor or picture gallery: otros dos payses [sic] a lo largo de una puerta Con dos Ramillerteros arriva y dos perros abajo sin marcos. In the collection valuation they were more explicitly described as dos quadros donde estan Unos Ramilleteros de flores de flandes y unos vidros y dulces con unos Perros (no. 49). The paintings were unframed and their dimensions given as 252 x 112 cm., which roughly corresponds with the present size of Van der Hamen's (228 x 95 cm.). Valued at thirty ducats each (330 reales), they were acquired from Solre's collection by the king. In the royal inventory of 1666 they were hanging in the room where the king dined in the Madrid Alcázar, described as Flemish pictures, and again valued at 30 ducats each (Jordan and Cherry 1995, p. 47). In the Prado pair, Van der Hamen displayed the full range of his talent in still life for one of his most appreciative patrons. Some of the elements in these unusual illusionistic still lifes were a familiar part of the repertory of still-life pictures on the theme of hospitality which Van der Hamen aimed at distinguished clients (subjects included ormolu vases, sweetmeats, and flowers). Solre may have particularly requested such a demonstration of Van der Hamen's skill in flower painting, an idiom associated with Flemish expertise and appropriate for a patron who may also have owned his Offering to Flora, discussed below. Van der Hamen's magnificent arrangements of flowers dwarf his other bouquets, and are much richer in blooms, including prominent tulips in one picture, perhaps the ones described as flores de flandes in the appraisal document. The unusual clock represented in one picture may have been designed to appeal to a patron who, judging from the valuation of his timepieces, may have had a taste for such things (AHPM, Prot. 5.328, ff. 121-121v). The pictures may also have complemented Solre's lifestyle in a literal sense if some of the objects represented were actually taken from life, including Solre's pet dogs. There was a mirror in the room where the paintings hung and attachments on the walls for bouquets of real flowers. Perhaps the wood and tile floor and serving tables covered with green damask reflected the actual decor of Solre's house. The inventory entry suggests that the paintings may have hung flanking a doorway on either side. Or, in their unframed state, they may have disguised a doorway, hanging the length of a door, perhaps set into the panels of a double door. Their illusionism would be most effective when hung together with the orthogonals of the tiled floor leading to a central vanishing point. However, the fact that Van der Hamen has represented the ends of the tables might imply an arrangement with the larger dog on the right of the smaller The clock shows almost five o'clock, perhaps time for a merienda of sweets and chilled wine. The illusionistic qualities of these large paintings with life-sized elements invite the viewer to sample the sweetmeats, catch the scent of the bouquets, and stroke the dogs. The function of the room in which Van der Hamen's illusionistic still lifes hung is unknown. This was decorated with landscapes and bird paintings, and was dominated by a pair of a large, unframed kitchen still lifes of fish and game birds, including a swan (nos. 44, 45), along with associated paintings of fowl hunts, a picture of different birds and landscapes. Solre's still lifes were appraised at 13,000 reales, worth many times the value of Van der Hamen's two still lifes and the most valuable pictures in Solre's collection, perhaps by a Flemish artist such as Frans Snyders. Not surprisingly, these first-rate paintings were both acquired by the king for the royal collection. This case of highly valued still lifes is paralleled by the still lifes in the collection of the Marqués de Montesclaros (Doc. 13). As noted above, marginal annotations to the appraisal document of Solre's collection specify paintings taken by Philip IV, perhaps to decorate the Buen Retiro palace. Evidently, the king took his pick of the pictures before the estate sale beginning on 1 July 1638, although it is not clear whether the works were bought or given. This was precisely at the time when the English ambassador, Sir Arthur Hopton, remarked on the quantity and quality of Philip IV's purchases of paintings. Philip acquired 28 of Solre's paintings: a religious subject (no. 6), 16 good-quality landscapes on panel, copper, and canvas (nos. 10, 11, 12), a valuable pair of scenes of boar and deer hunts (nos. 46), and nine of the genre and still-life pictures (nos. 5, 7, 9, 44, 45, 49, 51, 52), including a large and valuable painting of a festoon of fruit, flowers, and putti, which may have been a Flemish work (no. 4). Some of these paintings may have been destined to decorate the Buen Retiro palace. However, the latter paintings of hunts, genre scenes, and festoons exemplified Philip IV's taste for Flemish painting in the decoration of the summer apartments of the Madrid Alcázar, for which Van der Hamen had been commissioned to produce pendants to Flemish garland paintings with putti (Jordan and Cherry, Spanish Still Life, 1995, pp. 49-52). Indeed, the paintings inventoried in one large gallery of Solre's palace, the galeria Mayor, parallel the choice of subjects in Philip's recently decorated summer dining room of the Madrid Alcázar. The latter was hung with 30 Flemish pictures of broadly complementary subjects appropriate to the room's function, including hunting and animal pictures, the senses, genre paintings, and two paintings by Van der Hamen, representing a bowl of fruit and flowers held by a nude boy and a festoon. Nature's bounty was personified in Rubens and Snyders' collaborative painting of Ceres and Pan (Madrid, Prado) (M. Crawford Volk, Rubens in Madrid and the Decoration of the King's Summer Apartments, The Burlington Magazine, 123 [1981], pp. 526-529; Cherry 1991, pp. 122-124). Solre also appears to have decorated his large gallery with an eye to an analogous ensemble, since this was hung with some 36 paintings loosely associated with nature themes. Paintings of goddesses of nature and the seasons were placed in this gallery, which also included landscapes, hunting scenes, fruit still lifes, and genre paintings. A showpiece of the gallery was large copper of a Banquet of the Gods with small figures, which was probably Flemish. It may have been simply a matter of convenience to hang over the doors two genre paintings of toothpulling and soldiers playing cards (nos. 51, 52). These paintings were acquired by Philip IV, along with another painting of a nocturnal scene of music making and card playing (no. 7). It is not beyond the realm of possibility that the two former pictures could be identified with paintings of these subjects in the royal collection by Theodor Rombouts (1597-1637) (Díaz Padrón 1975, I, pp. 221-223). Two of the three large paintings with goddesses, fruit, and flowers that hung in the gallery were probably Van der Hamen's Pomona and Vertumnus (229 x 149 cm.) of 1626 (Fig. 31) and his Offering to Flora (216 x 140 cm.) of 1627 (Fig. 32), which are based on Flemish prototypes the artist knew from the royal collection (Cherry 1991, pp. 134-135; Jordan and Cherry 1995, pp. 56, 190, no. 28). The inventory descriptions are unfortunately somewhat cursory; the pictures were called tres pinturas con sus marcos de pino de negro, una de fructas con una figura de dama. otra de Rayces y otra de flores cada una de dhas tres pinturas de dos varas de alto y vara y media de ancho (measuring some 168 x 126 cm.). The three were separated into a pair (worth the relatively high sum of 2,400 reales) and a single painting (at 1,700 reales) in the valuation of Solre's collection: dos quadros de dos diosas una de flores y otro de fructas que tienen de cayda tres varas poco mas o menos y de ancho dos Varas menos sesma poco mas o menos (no. 47) and otro quadro del tamaño de Los dhos tanbien de una diossa con un canastilla de fructas en la mano (no. 48). Their dimensions were slightly larger in the latter entry, some 252 x 150 cm., closer in size to Van der Hamen's pictures, although the Offering to Flora has been slightly reduced in size. However, it is also possible that Solre's paintings are identifiable with three pastiches comprising elements from Van der Hamen and Rubens painted in Madrid in the 1630s, allegories of Spring, Summer, and Autumn that were listed in the collection of the Marqués de Leganés in 1655, although their appraised value would seem to argue against this (López Navío 1962, nos. 703-705; Jordan 1967, pp. 152-153; Jordan 1985, p. 146, no. 8). The third picture of a goddess with flowers (no. 48) was acquired by one Jacinto Lanini for 1500 reales (3 July 1638). The pair of allegories ascribed to Van der Hamen here were bought at Solre's estate auction for 1800 reales by Bartolomé Barrilaro (29 December 1638), who also bought four fruit still lifes, a portrait of the Queen of England, and four religious subjects. The allegories were not listed in his collection in 1651, although the portrait of the Queen of England which he bought from Solre's auction on 29 December 1638 was listed (Agulló Cobo 1981, pp. 210-211).","Collectors Files:  Solre, Comte de","input"

Later compared to original and changed 8/95.","In 1644 an inventory was taken of the paintings owned by a royal accountant (contador de resultas) Domingo Soria Arteaga, an official in the Contaduría general de cuentas de resultas, a body administering the finances of the Spanish crown. This document reveals him to have been an important collector of contemporary art. The inventory of the goods in Soria Arteaga's house on the calle de los Majadericos in central Madrid was begun on 9 June 1644, occasioned by the death of his wife Eugenia Enríquez Murtiel in childbirth on the previous day and the need to record the inheritance due to their seven small children. For the estate appraisal the painter Francisco de Burgos Mantilla was nominated to value the picture collection, which was undertaken on 20 October 1644. When Soria Arteaga married Eugenia Enríquez Murtiel (at an unspecified date) he owned a collection of some 50 paintings, a number which had risen to ca. 150 in 1644. On 3 September 1644, Soria Arteaga drew up his wife's last will and testament (AHPM, Prot. 6.935, ff. 593-601), which included a copy of the inventory of capital which he brought to their marriage (ff. 595-598). Here were listed 55 paintings, most of which correspond to numbers from the 1644 valuation. The capital also specifies that Soria Arteaga had exchanged a Sacrifice of Isaac and a Herodias for an Adoration of the Kings (uno de los reyes que tengo al Presente), and that he had exchanged a Conversion of the Magdalene for two still lifes of grapes, discussed below. The fact that Soria Arteaga himself oversaw the inventory and valuation of his own picture collection probably accounts for the high incidence of attributed works in the document, in which 103 paintings, as well as six sculptures, are assigned artists' names. Soria Arteaga's collection contained full-length portraits of himself, his wife, and their son (no. 41), but these were unattributed works, as is so often the case with portraits in documents such as these. Some works were attributed to artists who are now difficult to identify. One of these is Don Gaspar de Chiriboga, who painted a religious subject and a portrait (nos. 15 and 59) and who may even have been an amateur artist. Another artist's name (explanje) may be garbled in the document (no. 35). Three other minor painters represented in the collection, Francisco Verjes (no. 40), Juan de Riaño (no. 16) and Teodisio Mingot (no. 36), were reputable artists in Madrid of the time, but whose paintings are unknown today. Mingot (ca.1570-1620) was a pupil of the famous artist Gaspar Becerra and worked in fresco at the Escorial, Alcázar and El Pardo; he was mentioned with praise by Carducho, Jusepe Martínez, and Palomino (Carducho, ed. 1979, p. 332; Palomino, ed. 1986, p. 64). Like many of his peers, Soria Arteaga owned copies of paintings by Titian (no. 44) and Bassano (nos. 7 and 50). Unusually for a collector of his social status, there were also works that were considered originals by artists as famous as Titian (no. 47), Leonardo (no. 43), Jan Brueghel (no. 48), and Rubens (no. 14). It is significant, however, that original paintings by contemporary Spanish artists active at court outnumbered those of any other school. This suggests that Soria Arteaga was not only an important collector on the Madrid art market, owning paintings by Juan Fernández de Navarrete (no. 19) and El Greco (no. 30), for instance, but an important patron of living painters, many of whom he may have known personally. He owned two important figure paintings by Pedro Núñez del Valle, the Resurrection of Lazarus (no. 2) and Moses and Pharoah's Crown (no. 20). Francisco de Collantes was represented by Jacob and the Angel (no. 6), Fall of Troy (no. 31), and Conversion of Paul (no. 38). There was an Incarnation (no. 5) paired with an Immaculate Conception (no. 4) by Jusepe Leonardo, and a copy of one of his paintings of the Holy Family (no. 46), which suggests his work was particularly admired by Soria Arteaga. The most important painting by him in the collection was, however, the Moses and the Plague of Serpents (no. 21), valued by Burgos Mantilla at 1,500 reales, which could be the painting of this subject now in the Real Academia de San Fernando in Madrid (Fig. 16), thought to have been painted by Leonardo around 1635-40 (Angulo and Pérez Sánchez 1983, pp. 91-92, no. 27). This is clearly an ambitious history painting, containing a number of studies of the nude male, and was a work for which the artist may even have made a preparatory sketch (Ibid., p. 92, no. 28). Soria Arteaga owned one painting by Pedro de Orrente (no. 28), an artist whose works were sought by almost all collectors of note in Madrid, judging from the numbers which appear in their inventories. Like many of his peers, Soria Arteaga was also an admirer of Juan de la Corte's paintings with small figures in extensive architectural settings, and the fact that he owned 11 of these works (nos. 1, 22, 23, 37) suggests that he was one of the artist's staunchest admirers. The attribution added to no. 1 in brackets comes from the inventory. The collection of Soria Arteaga was more unusual for the owner's remarkable enthusiasm for still-life paintings, which made up one-third of the collection. In this respect, it is comparable to only one other collection published to date, that of the gentleman Don Francisco Merchant de la Cerda inventoried in 1662 (Agulló Cobo 1981, pp. 213-216). Perhaps Soria Arteaga's taste for still life induced him to have the collection valued by Francisco de Burgos Mantilla, a pupil of Velázquez who painted still life and one of whose paintings he also owned (no. 44). Juan van der Hamen was the best represented still-life painter in the collection. By Soria Arteaga's marriage, he already owned 23 still lifes, 17 of which were by Van der Hamen, and he boasted 21 of his paintings in 1644 (nos. 25, 72, and 73, coincidentally, Merchant de la Cerda owned the same number of Van der Hamens in 1662).  Merchant de la Cerda hung still-life paintings throughout his house and was particularly keen on the work of Juan de Espinosa, by whom he owned eight still lifes, a flowerpiece, and six bodegones. Soria Arteaga's collection contained only a pair of small still lifes by Espinosa (no. 26); he seems to have been far more interested in the work of Juan Fernández El Labrador, by whom he owned five still-life paintings (nos. 9, 10, and 33). Three of these were described as representing grapes, the subject matter at which the artist excelled and which was most sought after by collectors. In the inventory of the goods Soria Arteaga brought to his marriage, it was noted that, after the union, he exchanged a figure painting of the Conversion of Mary Magdalene for two still lifes of grapes, one by El Labrador and the other by Pietro Paolo Bonzi, whom he called by his nickname, the hunchback of Naples (no. 11). (AHPM, Prot. 6.935, f. 595, Un lienco de La conberssion de La magdalena quando La pedrico cristo con algunas figuras de bara y media de largo Y su moldura balia docientos E veinte y cinco Reales. este lienco Lo troque Despues de cassado Por un lienco Pequeño de Ubas del labrador Y otro del Corcobado de napoles de otras Ubas grandes moradas que Lo tengo al presente. It is worth noting that Burgos Mantilla appears to have thought more highly of the Labrador (no. 10), valuing this at seven times more than the Bonzi painting in the appraisal. Although Soria Arteaga does not mention the individual with whom he made the exchange, an ideal candidate could have been Giovanni Battista Crescenzi (d. 1635). Crescenzi, the Roman nobleman, architect, and amateur artist, was at the Spanish court since 1617, where he enjoyed a high reputation as a connoisseur of painting with a long-standing interest in still life painting, which he also practiced. He encouraged the painting of such pictures in his Roman academy, which included the young Pietro Paolo Bonzi, and promoted El Labrador among collectors at the Spanish court (Jordan and Cherry 1995, pp. 70-76). Soria Arteaga's acquisition of grape still lifes of Bonzi and Labrador can be interpreted as further circumstantial evidence linking the Spanish artist to sources in the Roman Caravaggesque milieu, from where his style has long thought to have derived. Soria Arteaga owned four still lifes by Antonio Ponce (nos. 32), a pupil of Van der Hamen, which may have been acquired directly from the artist, who lived on the same street as the contador at this date (Cherry 1991, p. 151). Two still lifes attributed to one Rumolo (no. 74), as well as sixteen landscape paintings listed by the same painter (no. 75), had been acquired before Soria Arteaga's marriage. This artist must have been Francisco de Rómulo Cincinnato, an artist who inherited the knighthood of the Order of Christ conferred on his better-known older brother, Diego de Rómulo (Palomino, ed. 1986, p. 105). The work of neither artist is known today. Among the pieces of wood sculpture listed at the end of Burgos Mantilla's appraisal, but not included in the transcription here, were two images of the child Jesus by the contemporary sculptor Juan de Bejerano. The identity of another master, called the mulato (no. 84), remains mysterious. Two scenes of the Nativity of Christ and the Flight into Egypt made with with small wax figures by one Jorge Salvador (no. 89) were also valued by the painter-appraiser and testify to the taste for such objects among the most discerning of connoisseurs of the time.","Cherry, Peter.

Other members of the Zúñiga family had also been prominent in foreign service: for example, Don Manuel's uncle, Don Baltasar de Zúñiga (died 1622), served as ambassador before the Holy See in Rome under Philip III and was later the leading statesman during the transition to the reign of Philip IV (Paz y Espeso 1948; Elliott 1968, pp. 325-26). In 1607, Don Manuel married Doña Leonor María de Guzmán (1591-1654/55), daughter of Don Enrique de Guzmán, 2nd Conde de Olivares (died 1607) and Doña María Pimentel de Azevedo y Zúñiga, who was Don Manuel's aunt. This marriage was coupled with that of Don Manuel's sister, Doña Inés de Zúñiga (died 1647), to Don Gaspar de Guzmán (1587-1645), who would become the Conde-Duque de Olivares and válido to Philip IV. Don Manuel and Doña Leonor would remain childless, so that the titles of Monterrey would pass to their first cousin, once removed, Doña Inés-Francisca de Zúñiga (ca. 1635-1710), granddaughter of the ambassador Don Baltasar. As it happened, Doña Inés-Francisca married, in 1652, Don Juan Domingo de Haro (ca. 1635?-1716), who was the son of Don Luis de Haro and the grand-nephew of the Conde-Duque de Olivares, with the result that the houses of Monterrey, Olivares, and Haro (the Marqueses del Carpio) were interlocked in a potent political alliance. This also complicated the succession of titles and, therefore, of each family's inheritance of pictures. In 1628, Don Manuel was appointed ambassador in Rome; he then served as Viceroy of Naples from 1631 to 1637. Don Manuel died in 1653 and Doña Leonor in late 1654 or early 1655. Their activities as patrons are discussed in the Introduction. Previous scholars have expressed surprise at the relatively small numbers of works in the Monterrey inventories. Indeed, in comparison to the holdings of the Carpios, Leganés, and the Almirantes, the approximately 265 Monterrey pictures inventoried in 1653 seem almost sparse. (Published by Pérez Sánchez, in Boletín de la Real Academia de la Historia, vol. 174, no. 3, 1977, pp. 417-59 and illustrations. As Pérez Sánchez makes clear, there is no one-to-one correspondence between the 1653 Monterrey inventory and the subsequent valuation. He nevertheless attempted to combine the two into one transcription, assigning lot numbers on the basis of the inventory. The transcriptions here are given verbatim.) However, the Monterrey inventory of 1653 does not encompass the entire estate. In addition to the house and gallery on the Prado, Don Manuel owned a house on the Plaza de Santo Domingo (Brown and Elliott 1980, p. 225, citing a letter by Fulvio Testi dated 19 November 1638, Lettere, vol. 3, letter no. 1345), another palace in Salamanca, and a seat in the Galician town of Monterrey (in Orense near the Portuguese border). Furthermore, as we shall see, his wife seems to have owned her pictures in her own right. The 1653 inventory itself is unusually disorganized, especially in the lack of coordination between the original enumerative inventory and the subsequent valuation. It is consequently difficult even to say whether all of the pictures at the Prado location, not to mention those at the other Madrid house, were included. (The inventory does speak of las casas del dicho conde (Pérez Sánchez 1977, pp. 420f.), but the plural was conventional in seventeenth-century documents. The inventory of paintings (22 April 1653) was, on the other hand, specifically located at the Jardín -- that is, in the gallery on the Prado -- but this datum is itself compromised by the lack of one-to-one correspondence between the April inventory and Pereda's valuations, 6-9 May.) One must also augment one's understanding of the Monterrey collection with the information garnered from the inventory of the Condesa, Doña Leonor, who in addition to being a collector in her own right, was certainly important in the Salamanca commissions. The fact that the Condesa's inventory of 1655 offers a relatively small overlap with that of 1653 most likely suggests that the pictures had been hers all along and not part of the common property, although it is theoretically possible that she collected the additional works in the less than two years between her husband's death and her own. In either case, we appear to have evidence of the activities of a woman collector, just as we now know that the Duquesa de Osuna was an important patron. Unfortunately, our appreciation of the works of art has been dimmed by the limited knowledge of Seicento painting which the painter Antonio de Pereda, the appraiser in both cases, brought to his tasks. It would seem that Pereda provided attributions only for older artists or for seventeenth-century masters well-known in Spain, like Ribera and Orazio Borgianni. Indeed, the names of contemporary artists that appear in the 1653 valuation seem to have been provided before the inventory was made. Consequently, many of the Monterrey pictures remained unattributed in both 1653 and 1655, and other documented works are not accounted for. For example, Carducho, writing before 1633, had located grandiose drawings of The Swimmers in colored chalk by the hand of Michelangelo in the Monterrey gallery and cited a Holy Family by Raphael, which Don Manuel had obtained from the Carmelitas Descalzas convent in Valladolid. (Carducho 1633, fols. 148 and 151 -- reprinted in Sánchez Canton, vol. 2, pp. 100f. and 103. Carducho indicates that Don Manuel had the painting by Raphael restored and intended to take it to Italy. Pérez Sánchez identifies it with no. 120 in the 1653 inventory. Carducho's report of the Michelangelo drawing is corroborated by contemporary Jesuit letters; see Pérez Sánchez 1977, pp. 419f. -- citing Cartas de Jesuitas, in Memorial Histórico Español, vol. 14, pp. 276 and 346.) Nevertheless, as noted in the Introduction, even the fragmentary evidence suggests an extremely impressive gallery. Certain other aspects of the inventory process itself, already noted by Pérez Sánchez with regard to the 1653 inventory (Pérez Sánchez 1977, passim), are important enough to bear repeating. In the first place, Pereda, in spite of his own reluctance to attribute works, seems to have used his appraisals as vehicles for occasional comments on a given attribution. Thus, no. 109, a small St. Thomas Aquinas and Bonaventure, attributed to Titian in the inventory, is listed in the valuation without attribution at 77 reales -- a relatively tiny sum. Less certain is Pereda's opinion on no. 6, a Cupid attributed to Titian in the inventory, which again Pereda lists without attribution but at the middling price of 1,800 reales in the valuation. One may reasonably speculate whether a strong-willed widow with her own interest in collecting might have intervened in Pereda's activities, causing him to keep quiet about some works and quietly drop disputed attributions in other cases. One identification by Pérez Sánchez, that of a St. Catherine Adoring the Crucifix, no. 69 in 1653, with a painting now in Boston (no. 48.499), serves to underscore the complicated inter-relationship between the Monterrey and Olivares-Carpio families. In 1651 (two years before the Conde de Monterrey's death) a painting of an identical subject, attributed to Titian, appeared in the inventory of Don Gaspar de Haro, the son of Don Luis de Haro (Doc. 49, no. 155). Don Gaspar's inventory is more detailed than that of the Monterrey inventory, and it appears to describe the Boston picture exactly, if one substitutes tree (arbol) given in the description for arch (arco). According to the Duque del Berwick y Alba, this painting was willed to Charles II in 1675, but the offer was revoked by Don Gaspar sometime before his death in Naples in 1687 (Berwick y Alba 1924, p. 93). At any rate, the picture appears in the Haro (Carpio) inventory of 1689 (Doc. 115, no. 561). Wethey considers it a workshop piece but implies extensive participation by Titian himself. The facts just cited yield two possibilities: either there were two very similar pictures of St. Catherine by Titian in seventeenth-century Madrid, or there was only one picture, which moved back and forth between the Monterrey and Haro/Carpio collections. The latter option seems by far the most reasonable: the subject is unique in Titian's extant oeuvre, and the very high valuations -- 4,950 reales in 1653 and 22,000 in 1689 -- suggest that the inventoried works were both thought originals at the time. Furthermore, there is evidence that the two collections shaded together in the next generation: Berwick y Alba cites a letter by Don Gaspar de Haro, seeking to sell two more of the Monterrey canvases, a Venus and Adonis and a Monstrous Boy, both by Ribera (1653 nos. 4 and 186), for expenses related to his supervision of the Buen Retiro in 1656 (Berwick y Alba 1924, p. 92; bibliography summarized in Felton 1982, pp. 179-80). Since the Monterrey estate was the property of Don Gaspar's brother and sister-in-law, Doña Inés-Francisca de Zúñiga, Condesa de Monterrey from 1653, one must assume that either Don Gaspar had acquired two of the Monterrey works or he had asked his family to help subsidize the palace's upkeep. (This sequence of events, which I worked out jointly with Dr. Felton, has been published by him in a different context, with information on other related works; see Felton 1982, pp. 178-181.) In either case, it is clear that the Monterrey and Haro/Carpio collections were closely linked.","Collectors Files:  Monterrey","input"

Will, inventory, tasación, and partition of the estate of Doña Catalina Fernández de Cardona Córdoba y Aragón, wife of Don Luis Méndez de Haro;  she died 19 November 1647.  The paintings were evaluated by Francisco Barrera on 19 May 1648 (entered 30 May).   Doña Catalina, daughter of the Duques de Segorbe y de Cardona, married Don Luis on 28 October 1624, having signed capitulaciones matrimoniales at San Lorenzo el Real (that is, El Escorial) and Madrid, 19-20 October 1624 (dowry, fols. 525 ff.).  Although she brought 100,000 ducats to the marriage (an immense sum), no paintings of value were included.  Since Don Luis did not inherit the estates of Carpio and Morente from his father until 1648, the inventory, which records their estate as of 1647, does not include his inheritance, and therefore represents their joint collecting activities from 1624 to 1647. Unfortunately, we have no way of knowing which pictures (apart from those in her dowry) were hers, which were his, and which were theirs.'
