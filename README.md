## Installation Instructions
**Requirements: Python, Jupyter Notebooks**

If you want to use the notebook, you'll want to setup Jupyter Notebooks in some form on your computer. Git/Github-Desktop are probably good means of getting the notebook from the online repository onto your computer. The following steps should get you started.
### Setting Up
2. Install Python and Jupyter Notebooks. Realistically, the simplest way to do this is [to install Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com), which will handle the Python environment, packages, etc. When installing, accept the recommended setup configuration.
3. [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). This is a program and is separate from Github (which is an online platform for storing data and coordinating usersâ€”not a program). Accept the recommended setup configuration. 
5. Download Github Desktop. Install and clone this Github repository (https://github.com/pyzmark/gpi-datathon) to your local hard drive (it will probably go to the default location at: ~/Documents/Github/). See here for [instructions on cloning a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop).
6. You should be all set up.
